  abstract={This article is presented as a case study illustrating the interplay between theory-testing, personality scale development, and construct validation. A new construct, hagioptasia, is proposed and scale development and initial construct validity research are described. Hagioptasia is conceptualized as a tendency to perceive certain persons and places are preternaturally ``special{''} and as a desire to participate in that otherworldly specialness when, objectively, there is really nothing unearthly about the person or situation. Item and factor analyses support a general construct of hagioptasia with two subthemes: (1) attraction to glamourous, famous persons and a desire for similar achievement and recognition and (2) an aesthetic sense of wonder and transcendence. Items assessing these two subthemes correlated with a short measure of Enterprising and Artistic vocational interests, respectively. While the theory of hagioptasia and the validity of a hagioptasia scale received some support through associations with age, gender, educational level, and religious orientation, difficulties were noted with reverse-scored items and with assessing hagioptasia as an illusory or purely imaginary perception of specialness. Directions for future scale development and theory-testing are discussed.},

Fifty-one IPC items were administered to 321 participants (248 women, 73 men), along with other measures of curiosity and personality. Three factors were identified from which five-item subscales were developed that had good internal consistency: Curiosity about Emotions, Spying and Prying, and Snooping. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the three-factor model had acceptable fit. The IPC scales correlated positively with other curiosity measures and interest in gossip, providing evidence of convergent validity. Divergent validity was demonstrated in finding the other curiosity scales correlated more highly with each other than with IPC; parallel results were found for the gossip measures.

  abstract={The structure and measurement of occupational fraud rationalization as one of the motivations for fraudulent behavior has been a major obstacle in theoretical research and practical problems. In order to answer the fundamental question, ``What does cognitive rationalization of occupational fraud involve?,{''} this paper explored the structure and scale development of the internal psychological factors of occupational fraud rationalization. Several research methods were used for this purpose, such as data collection, research interviews, review \& verification, project purification, structural verification, and reliability \& validity test. The results showed that, based on the internal structure, occupational fraud rationalization presented second-order three-dimensional and first-order eight-dimensional factors. Further, a formal scale containing 27 items related to the structure of the metric was constructed to measure the occupational fraud rationalization. In terms of variable correlations, this paper empirically tested the criterion validity of occupational fraud rationalization from the perspective of personality traits. The result revealed a significant positive (negative) correlation between Machiavellian traits (empathy traits) and occupational fraud rationalization, respectively. In conclusion, this paper provides an attempt to address the cognitive and measurement challenges of occupational fraud rationalization, expanding the application and development of moral disengagement theory in the field of occupational fraud and laying some groundwork for subsequent research and development.},

  abstract={This study expands on past deceleration and slow consumption research by introducing and validating a measure of need-for-deceleration, an individual's motivational ability to engage in activities aimed at slowing down the perceived fast passage of time. Following initial scale development, two studies establish construct validity by placing need-for-deceleration into a nomological network. Results indicate that the measure correlated with, but was distinct from, variables involving negative affective states, such as state anxiety and neuroticism. Need-for-deceleration scores were not related to materialism, but negatively correlated with self-efficacy, life satisfaction, work-life balance, and conscientiousness. Correlations were positive with need-for-uniqueness, future time orientation, and susceptibility to normative influence. Need-for-deceleration was also associated with regulatory focus (positively with prevention, and negatively with promotion focus). To explore criterion validity, a third study establishes associations between need-for-deceleration and consumer lifestyle variables. Developing and validating the scale can help researching and managing products relating to the consumption of time, wellness, mindfulness, and simplicity.},

  abstract={Human beings seek out social interactions as a source of reward. To date, there have been limited attempts to identify different forms of social reward, and little is known about how the value of social rewards might vary between individuals. This study aimed to address both these issues by developing the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ), a measure of individual differences in the value of different social rewards. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was run on an initial set of 75 items (N = 305). Based on this analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was then conducted on a second sample (N = 505) with a refined 23-item scale. This analysis was used to test a six-factor structure, which resulted in good model fit (CFI = 0.96, RSMEA = 0.07). The factors represent six subscales of social reward defined as follows: Admiration; Negative Social Potency; Passivity; Prosocial Interactions; Sexual Reward; and Sociability. All subscales demonstrated good test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Each subscale also showed a distinct pattern of associations with external correlates measuring personality traits, attitudes, and goals, thus demonstrating construct validity. Taken together, the findings suggest that the SRQ is a reliable, valid measure that can be used to assess individual differences in the value experienced from different social rewards.},

  abstract={This research details the development of the ``comfort with interpersonal touch{''} (CIT) scale designed to measure individual differences in interpersonal touch tendencies and preferences. The CIT construct is defined as the degree to which an individual is comfortable with intentional interpersonal touch from or to another person. The scale incorporates the distinction between initiating touch, which is the act of touching someone else, and receiving touch, which is the act of being touched by someone else. Investigation of this construct includes scale development, measure purification, and validation. We situate CIT-initiating and CIT-receiving within an approach avoidance framework and demonstrate that comfort with initiating touch is more related to approach tendencies such as assertiveness while comfort with receiving touch is more related to avoidant tendencies such as avoiding crowded spaces. While previous research generally finds positive effects of interpersonal touch, we find that these effects, at least in part, depend on an individual's comfort with interpersonal touch. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications as well as future research opportunities using the CIT scale. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

By developing a sound measure to assess attitudes and behavioral reactions to strikes, we will be in a better position to evaluate these constructs in individuals and compare across studies. Therefore, we developed a scale to assess attitudes and behavioral reactions to strikes following classic scale development guidelines using four samples (total N = 1369; N-1 = 304, N-2 = 209, N-3 = 443, N-4 = 413). In Study 1, we used exploratory factor analysis to reduce the generated items to a scale and showed that the strike attitude and behavioral reactions scale consists of one affective factor (negative reactions towards strikes), one cognitive factor (legitimacy of strikes), and three behavioral factors (informing oneself about strikes, strike-related social network behavior, and support of strikers). Study 2 confirmed these five factors and showed acceptable psychometric properties. Study 3 supported the construct validity of the developed scale: the five factors were correlated with willingness to strike and attitudes towards unions, among other variables. Study 4 further showed that the scale can also capture attitudes and behavioral reactions towards specific strikes. Overall, these studies indicate that the strike attitude and behavioral reactions scale is a psychometrically sound measure consisting of five factors.},

GNS subscales exhibit high reliability, with several being substantially more reliable than their NPI counterparts. As a full-scale, the GNS correlates with other variables in a way that is consistent with the theoretical portrait of GN.

As expected Americans showed higher levels of happiness than Poles, yet the relationship between trust and happiness was positive and similar in strength for both countries.

Examination of convergent and discriminant validity indicated that the two scales measured distinct and specific constructs.

However, there is a scarcity of academic research on the psychological effects and mechanisms of video conferencing, and scholars need tools to understand this drastically scaled usage. The current paper presents the development and validation of the Zoom Exhaustion \& Fatigue Scale (ZEF Scale). In one qualitative study, we developed a set of interview prompts based on previous work on media use. Those interviews resulted in the creation of 49 survey items that spanned several dimensions. We administered those items in a survey of 395 respondents and used factor analyses to reduce the number of items from 49 to 15, revealing five dimensions of fatigue: general, social, emotional, visual, and motivational fatigue. Finally, in a scale validation study based on 2724 respondents, we showed the reliability of the overall scale and the five factors and demonstrated scale validity in two ways. First, frequency, duration, and burstiness of Zoom meetings were associated with a higher level of fatigue. Second, fatigue was associated with negative attitudes towards the Zoom meetings. We discuss future directions for validation and expansion of the scale.},

Results from three samples of undergraduates showed the MEMS to have favorable psychometric properties (e.g. good factor structure and reliability) and demonstrated that it can effectively differentiate the three subconstructs of meaning. Regression and relative importance analyses showed that each MEMS subscale carried predictive power for relevant variables and other meaning measures. Additionally, the MEMS subscales demonstrated theoretically consistent, differential associations with other variables (e.g. dogmatism, behavioral activation, and spirituality). Overall, results suggest that the MEMS may offer more conceptual precision than existing measures, and it may open new avenues of research and facilitate a more nuanced understanding of MIL.},

  abstract={Scales of Need for Cognition (NFC), Typical Intellectual Engagement (TIE), and Epistemic Curiosity (EC) measure intellectual curiosity (IC). These scales correlate strongly and have been factor-analyzed individually but not together. Here N = 396 (143 males) undergraduates completed measures of NFC, TIE, and EC. Six factors, labeled Intellectual Avoidance, Deprivation, Problem Solving, Abstract Thinking, Reading, and Wide Interest, were identified. TIE is the broadest scale, measuring all factors except Deprivation; NFC measures Intellectual Avoidance and Problem Solving, plus Abstract Thinking and Deprivation to a lesser degree; and EC largely measures Deprivation. Moreover, Reading may not fit in the IC domain; higher-order factor analysis indicated that, whereas items measuring Reading loaded more strongly on their first-order factor, items measuring the other factors strongly loaded on a general factor of IC. These results are significant for understanding the contents of these scales, and for future scale development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To address this problem, we describe two studies that examined the factor structure of a broad range of narcissism items and the implications for current narcissism theory. In Study 1, 881 undergraduates completed a scale composed of items taken trans-theoretically from narcissism scales that targeted grandiose, vulnerable, and normal narcissism descriptions. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted and construct validity was established. In Study 2, 298 community-based participants were surveyed. Fit indices of a reduced 20-item scale and test-retest reliability were examined. Both studies supported a hierarchical structure of distinct grandiose and vulnerable factors, each with interpersonal and intrapersonal components. Thus, trait narcissism seems best described by grandiose and vulnerable dimensions, each of which can be focused toward the self or others.},

Although many earlier studies have empirically investigated conditions under which negative or positive effects predominate, few of them considered why passenger presence has these effects. The present paper aimed to contribute to the understanding of this question by identifying dimensions of psychological effects of passenger presence that can influence the likelihood that drivers are involved in crashes. A multidimensional scale was developed by means of factor analysis. Data were collected from drivers who drive regularly with their spouses as passengers. Five dimensions were identified: ``pique,{''} ``flattery, vanity, and overdependence,{''} ``relief,{''} ``responsibility,{''} and ``annoyance.{''} Each dimension's subscale was shown to have a sufficient level of internal consistency and significant associations with external criteria on marital relationships and personality characteristics. The findings could serve as an important scientific basis for consideration of how to maximize the positive effects or minimize the negative effects of passenger presence.

We aimed to replicate the MACH-IV psychopathy relations, demonstrate the validity of the FFMI by assessing its relations with the NEO-PI-R and the HEXACO facets, and link the FFMI to a broad range of work-related criteria. We replicated the MACH-IV psychopathy relations and found a very high (rICCS= .91) absolute profile similarity between the FFMI's correlations with the NEO-PI-R in our sample (N = 572) and the correlation profile for the same variables reported by Collison and colleagues. Both the NEO-PI-R and HEXACO-PI-R profiles for the FFMI found in the current study supported its distinctiveness from traditional measures of Machiavellianism, which converged greatly with the correlation profiles for the FFMI-antagonism dimension. A cluster analysis also showed a substantial proportion of Five Factor Machiavellian individuals. In addition, the FFMI displayed positive relations with a broad range of criteria for vocational and work-related success and was clearly distinct from psychopathy.},

Criterion validity was evaluated through the association with related variables, such as age and school failure, as well as the scale's ability to capture group differences, namely between genders and school retentions, and finally by comparing a sub-group of convicted adolescents with a group of non-convicted ones regarding their engagement in delinquent activities. Overall, the scale presented good psychometric properties, with results supporting that the DBVS is a valid and reliable self-reported measure to evaluate adolescents' involvement in deviance.},

We do this by clearly aligning the risk in the items with the particular domain of risk, reducing item ambiguity, and reducing the impact of prior knowledge. We developed the MDRT using an Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and Item Response Theory (IRT) approach with a community sample (N = 921). We examined its construct and convergent validity (N = 493) and construct generalizability (N = 487). We found that the MDRT had excellent internal consistency, dimensionality and latent factor structure. The MDRT also demonstrated significant convergent validity with related scales used in the literature. The MDRT is shown to be a promising alternative measure of risk attitudes.},

In the current research we join these efforts to understand belonging by offering a novel framework for exploring an understudied but no less fundamental aspect of human experience-time. We situate this framework within an existential analysis of human action and test general predictions about the psychological value of experiencing a sense of belonging in time, what we call temporal rootedness. Two samples (Studies 1 and 2) collected across cultures provide converging evidence that temporal rootedness is a unique psychological phenomenon that is predictive of personal psychological well-being. Two additional experiments (Studies 3 and 4) offer promising evidence that temporal rootedness can be situationally induced and threatened with consequences for well-being. These findings demonstrate the potential value of further exploration into this sense of belonging.},

  abstract={Finding meaning in our lives is a central tenet to the human experience and a core contributor to mental health. Individuals tend to actively seek the sources of meaning in their lives or consciously enact efforts to create or ``craft{''} meaning in different life domains. These overall ``Life Crafting{''} behaviors refer to the conscious efforts individuals exert to create meaning in their lives through (a) cognitively (re-)framing how they view life, (b) seeking social support systems to manage life challenges, and (c) actively seeking challenges to facilitate personal growth. Specifically, these behaviors are actioned to better align life goals, personal needs, values, and capabilities. However, no psychological assessment instrument currently exists to measure overall life crafting. As such, the purpose of this paper was twofold: to conceptualize life crafting and to develop, validate and evaluate a robust measure of overall life crafting. A mixed-method, multi-study research design was employed. First, nine participants were interviewed to determine the methods or techniques used to craft meaningful life experiences. These methods/techniques were used as indicators to create an initial item pool which was then reviewed by a panel of experts to ensure face validity. Second, in Study 1, the factorial structure of the instrument was explored by gathering data from a convenience sample (N = 331), with the results showing support for a three-factor structure of life crafting, consisting of (a) cognitive crafting, (b) seeking social support, and (c) seeking challenges. Finally, in Study 2 (N = 362), the aim was to confirm the factorial structure of the Life Crafting scale and to determine its level of internal consistency, partial measurement invariance across genders, and criterion validity {[}meaning in life (beta = 0.91), mental health (beta = 0.91), work engagement (beta = 0.54), and job burnout (beta = -0.42)]. The results supported a second-order factorial model of Life Crafting, which comprised of three first-order factors (cognitive crafting, seeking social support, and seeking challenges). Therefore, the Life Crafting Scale can be used as a valid and reliable instrument to measure- and track the effectiveness of life crafting interventions.},

  abstract={Curiosity is a fundamental human motivation that influences learning, the acquisition of knowledge, and life fulfillment. Our ability to understand the benefits (and costs) of being a curious person hinges on adequate assessment. Synthesizing decades of prior research, our goal was to improve a well-validated, multi-dimensional measure of curiosity (Kashdan et al., 2018). First, we sought to distinguish between two types of social curiosity: the overt desire to learn from other people versus covert, surreptitious interest in what other people say and do. Second, we sought to remove weaker items and reduce the length of each subscale. Using data from a survey of 483 working adults (Study 1) and 460 community adults (Study 2), we found evidence to support the preexisting four dimensions of curiosity (Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Thrill Seeking) along with the separation of the fifth dimension into Overt Social Curiosity and Covert Social Curiosity. Each factor of the Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale Revised (5DCR) had substantive relations with a battery of personality (e.g., Big Five, intellectual humility) and well-being (e.g., psychological need satisfaction) measures. With greater bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DCR offers new opportunities for basic research and the evaluation of curiosity enhancing interventions.},

Importantly, the FI-Scale predicts a broad range of consumption-related behaviors (e.g., spending despite anticipated spousal disapproval, preferences for discreet payment methods and unmarked packaging, concealing bank account information). Our work is the first to introduce, define, and measure financial infidelity reliably and succinctly and examine its antecedents and consequences.},

Initial evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the BWBS indicated that this new scale has acceptable psychometric properties. In both studies, associations between each subscale, representing the above four dimensions, and multiple self-report measures of experienced well-being were also examined. Each subscale was significantly associated with well-being, with Self-Development and Contribution to Others indicating stronger associations with measures of well-being than either Experience of Pleasure or Avoidance of Negative Experience. Implications for future research using this economical new scale are discussed.},

  abstract={Attachment theory was built around the idea that infants rely on others to survive, and it is often forgotten that survival hinged on coping with environmental demands. Adult attachment reports have instead been organized around people's subjective experience of safety and security in relationships. To resolve the gap between infant's physical needs and adult attachment experiences, we made a first step by developing the Social Thermoregulation and Risk Avoidance Questionnaire (STRAQ-1) in 12 countries (N = 1510), providing a complementary measure to identify biological drives formative to attachment. We conjectured that co-regulatory patterns of temperature and stress are foundational to attachment styles and on this basis used a naive bootstrapping method to find a robust solution, conducting seven exploratory factor analyses in an exploratory-confirmatory fashion. We identified 23 (out of 57) items in 4 subscales: Social Thermoregulation (Total Omega = .83), High Temperature Sensitivity (.83), Solitary Thermoregulation (.77), and Risk Avoidance (.57). In terms of external validity, we also found that the STRAQ-1 relates to emotion regulation strategies broadly and, importantly, relates to individual differences in attachment specifically, which in turn mediates the relationship with stress and health (making the scale face valid). Our approach provides a robust first effort in identifying biological mechanisms underlying attachment formation.},

When the viewer is fully engaged, aesthetic experiences are comparable with flow experiences, which are optimal experiences described by people as ``being in the zone{''} or ``getting lost{''} in the moment. This study uses the framework of aesthetic experiences by Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson (1990), which conceptualizes aesthetic experiences as having 4 art-related dimensions and a fifth flow dimension. Using this conceptualization, we created the Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (AEQ) and tested its validity in a general population of Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Results demonstrated that the AEQ consists of 4 artistically related dimensions (i.e., perceptual, emotional, cultural, understanding) and 2 flow dimensions (i.e., proximal conditions, experience). The AEQ demonstrated convergent validity with related constructs (i.e., openness to experience, inspiration, curiosity and exploration), and individuals with greater artistic experience had more intense ratings of aesthetic experiences. Overall, this study lends support to Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson's framework of aesthetic experiences and provides a useful measure of aesthetic experiences for future studies.},

However, most research on controlled processing has examined controlled processing based on situational factors that can be experimentally manipulated. While this is a valuable endeavor, it does not capture important differences that naturally exist between art viewers. To rectify this, the current study developed a measure of individual differences in controlled processing within aesthetics, the Aesthetic Processing Preference Scale (APPS). The APPS was constructed along three dimensions of controlled processing in aesthetic experience: Appreciation for Complexity in art, Intolerance for Ambiguity in art, and the Propensity to Contextualize artworks. In two studies, participants completed the APPS as well as convergent and divergent validity measures. Across both studies, the APPS was found to be a reliable and valid measure of controlled processing. The utility of the APPS to future researchers and educators is in accounting for the reasons that someone is likely to engage in controlled processing, providing further insight into human motivation.},

However, no validated assessment has been developed to measure second order mentalization (one's beliefs about how transparent one's thoughts are to others), or whether this capacity plays a significant role in social interaction. The current work presents a interactive mentalization theory, which divides these directional and second order aspects of mentalization, and investigates whether these constructs are measurable, stable, and meaningful in social interactions. We developed a 20-item, self-report interactive mentalization questionnaire (IMQ) in order to assess the different sub-components of mentalization: self-self, self-other, and other-self mentalization (Study 1). We then tested this scale on a large, online sample, and report convergent and discriminant validity in the form of correlations with other measures (Study 2), as well as correlations with social deception behaviors in real online interaction with Mturk studies (Study 3 and Study 4). These results validate the IMQ, and support the idea that these three factors can predict mentalization in social interaction.},

Study 1 (N = 266) investigated the factor structure of item candidates when respondents were instructed to think of 18- and 19-year-olds as juveniles. An exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-factor model, with each having acceptable reliability. Additionally, based on the characteristics of each item, which were examined using the graded response model, 10 items were retained in the provisional scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis conducted in Study 2 (N = 866) confirmed the two-factor model and its generalizability to other age groups (i.e. 16/17 and 14/15). Convergent validity with social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism, incremental validity with support for harsher punishment and rehabilitation, and real-name reporting were examined and confirmed. Overall, the results support the reliability, convergent validity, and incremental validity of the MPJS.},

  abstract={The lockdown situation caused by COVID-19 has increased the use of social networks, which could, in turn, increase social networks addiction. This research consists of two integrated studies aimed at (1) developing and validating the Social Networks Motives Scale (SN-MotiveS) and (2) examining the relationships between the frequency of use of social networks and the motives for why individuals use social networks with social networks addiction, as well as the evolution of these variables over time before (through a retrospective assessment), during, and after lockdown. During lockdown, an online questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 482 participants (Study 1). After lockdown, 114 participants from Study 1 completed a second online questionnaire, forming a longitudinal study (Study 2). Study 1 showed a robust fit for the multifactorial structure of the SN-MotiveS with four factors (socialization, escapism, prosocial behavior, and self-presentation), supporting the external validity of the scale, and the expected correlation patterns were found with social networks frequency of use, abuse, and addiction. Study 2 showed that all the motives increased during lockdown except for self-presentation, whereas after lockdown only prosocial behavior and employment (added in Study 2) decreased significantly. Moreover, the self-presentation and escapism motives acted as mediators in the relationship between social networks frequency of use and social networks addiction. This research provides a reliable instrument to measure the motives for using social networks both during a pandemic and in normal times. In addition, it highlights the importance of paying special attention to escapism motives for predicting social networks addiction in periods of lockdown.},

  abstract={People vary in experiences of positive and negative emotions from consuming alcohol, but no validated measurement instrument exclusively devoted to assessing drinking emotions exists in the literature. The current research validated and evaluated the psychometric properties of an alcohol affect scale based on adjectives from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and tested the extent that emotions incurred from drinking were distinct from general trait-based emotions. Three studies tested independent samples of adult alcohol users. In Study 1 (N = 494), exploratory factor analyses of the Alcohol PANAS revealed that both the 20-item model and the 9-parcel model (represented by similar mood content) supported the 2-factor dimensionality of alcohol positive and negative affect. In Study 2 (N = 302), confirmatory factor analyses corroborated the measurement structure of alcohol positive and negative affect, and both constructs evidenced statistical independence from general positive and negative affect. In Study 3 (N = 452), alcohol positive and negative affect exhibited discriminant, convergent, and criterion validity with established alcohol scales. Incremental validity tests demonstrated that alcohol positive and negative affect uniquely contributed (beyond general positive and negative affect) to alcohol expectancies, use, and problems. Findings support that alcohol emotions are conceptually distinct from trait emotions, and underscore the necessity of an assessment instrument tailored to the former to examine associations with alcohol beliefs and behaviors. The Alcohol PANAS confers theoretical and practical applications to understand the emotional consequences of drinking.},

  abstract={There are many adaptive functions of music listening (AFML) that are relevant for understanding wellbeing. Functions relating to mood and emotion regulation dominate general measures of music listening functions. Eudaimonic functions of music listening (FML) have been identified, but no scale has been developed to measure these functions. The current study reports on the development of a new measure to assess eudaimonic music listening functions. Items were developed based on a prior qualitative study and a literature review focused on music listening and wellbeing. The factor structure was investigated by EFA and CFA in a large sample of participants (N= 637, 17-66 years,M= 22.04,SD= 6.23, 326 males). Tests of dimensionality revealed a three factor scale with seven items. The scale and its subscales possess good internal consistency. The Eudaimonic FML scale measures Transcendence, Flow, and Peak Experience. Contrary to expectations eudaimonic FML did not relate to higher wellbeing (higher positive affect, lower negative affect, higher life satisfaction), rather results suggest that these FML are associated with greater emotional experience more generally. This brief scale will have applications in research focused on music listening benefits, music selection preferences, and experimental and developmental effects of music listening on psychological outcomes.},

  abstract={Since the origins of psychology, curiosity has occupied a pivotal position in the study of motivation, emotion, and cognition; and disciplines as far-ranging as biology, economics, robotics, and leadership. Theorists have disagreed about the basic tenets of curiosity; some researchers contend that the rewards arise when resolving ambiguity and uncertainty whereas others argue that being curious is an intrinsically pleasurable experience. Three studies were conducted to consolidate competing theories and isolated bodies of research. Using data from a community survey of 508 adults (Study 1), 403 adults on MTurk (Study 2), and a nationally representative household survey of 3,000 adults (Study 3), we found evidence for five distinct factors: Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, Social Curiosity, and Thrill Seeking - forming The Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale (5DC). Each factor had substantive relations with a battery of personality, emotion, and well-being measures. Taking advantage of this multidimensional model, we found evidence for four distinct types of curious people in Study 3 referred to as The Fascinated (28\% of sample), Problem Solvers (28\%), Empathizers (25\%), and Avoiders (19\%). Subgroups differed in their passionate interests, areas of expertise, consumer behavior, and social media use; challenging an assumption that there is a homogenous population to be discriminated on a single dimension from incurious to very curious. With greater bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DC offers new opportunities for research on origins, consequences, life outcomes, and intervention strategies to enhance curiosity.

  abstract={The present study was designed to develop and describe the psychometric properties of the Self-satisfaction Scale (3S) among adults (including emerging adults) for the community sample. The research included three distinct studies. In Study 1, item pool generation and evaluation of content validity of the new scale by expert panel were carried out. In Study 2 (n = 532), the factor structure of 3S was examined with Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and the internal consistency of the new scale was evaluated. In Study 3 (n = 503) Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed on the items determined by EFA in a different sample and the convergent validity of the new scale was assessed. EFA results displayed that 3S had seven factors accounting for 73.87\% of the initial total variance and CFA results confirmed that these seven distinct but correlated factors were related to self-satisfaction on social, physical health, cognitive, emotional/psychological, physical appearance, sexual, and personality characteristics domains. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega) of the 3S was .96 and all subscales had high internal consistency. To assess the convergent validity, 3S was administered together with Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS; Diener), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The results revealed that 3S was positively correlated with the LSS, positive affect, and RSES while it was negatively correlated with negative affect and BDI. Test-retest reliability (N = 64) for total 3S was .89. Findings suggest that 3S is a psychometrically valid and reliable tool to assess self-satisfaction among adults and emerging adults.},

  abstract={Work engagement has been an extremely popular area of research and practice over the past two decades. However, organizational scholars have yet to consider potentially more appropriate ways of modeling how individuals report their work engagement and, relatedly, of measuring it. This article seeks to (1) establish that individuals use an ideal point (vs. dominance) process to respond to work engagement items, (2) develop a construct valid work engagement scale with good psychometric properties using the ideal point framework, and (3) demonstrate the potential advantages that our ideal point scales can offer over existing dominance scales for work engagement research and practice. These goals were accomplished using a multi-phase approach. In Phase 1 we constructed a new ideal point work engagement scale (the IPWES), a short form (the IPWES-SF), and a dominance-style scale for comparisons (the DWES). In Phase 2, the psychometric performance of the IPWES was compared with that of the DWES and existing work engagement scales. Consistent with theory, the IPWES exhibited better fit, a more equal distribution of test information across the latent continuum, and different latent estimates towards the positive and negative ends of the continuum. Finally, Phase 3 established the construct validity of the IPWES and demonstrated its utility for uncovering curvilinear relationships with correlates of engagement over existing dominance-based scales. Notably, our findings were replicated with the IPWES-SF, supporting the use of the short version even in the study of complex relationships.},

  abstract={Research exploring nonbelievers' reasons for not believing in the existence of god(s) has focused on theory development. Such efforts are valuable, but may not capture the lived experiences of nonbelievers. The current two studies quantitatively examined nonbelievers' self-reported reasons for nonbelief through developing the Reasons of Atheists and Agnostics for Nonbelief in God's Existence Scale (RANGES). We developed an initial pool of 64 items using prior published research, revised by a panel of experts including researchers and thought leaders in nonbelief communities. Both studies included participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Study 1 \& 2 Ns = 520 \& 369), all of whom reported not believing in god(s). In Study 1, our exploratory factor analysis suggested nine factors across 35 items. In Study 2, we confirmed the nine-factor structure using 38 items (35 from Study 1 plus three new items for better coverage of factors with few items) with adequate fit. Across both studies, the RANGES subscales showed good reliability, convergent validity (e.g., positive correlations with previous lists of reasons for religious doubt), predictive validity (e.g., positive and negative feelings toward God and religion), and discriminant validity (e.g., subscales were not unexpectedly associated with other measures). Our 1-year follow-up with a subset of Study 2 participants (N = 132) found different levels of stability among the RANGES subscales. This measure can promote further understanding the motivations, identities, and experiences of nonbelievers across cultures.},

  abstract={James Fowler's model of faith development conceptualized ``faith{''} as the quest for and maintenance of meaning oriented around centers of value which may or may not be religious or spiritual in nature. Although this model foreshadowed later work in meaning in life, substantial bodies of literature have developed in each area, almost entirely independently of the other. Integration has been hindered by measurement difficulties in faith development work. Fowler's stages of faith development and their reformulation as Streib's religious styles are usually measured through either a lengthy Faith Development Interview or short measures that do not assess the breadth of domains covered in the interview. These short measures are in many cases oriented around religious faith and impossible for a non-believer to answer. Embedded within the original model and the interview are aspects of faith development including perspective taking, social horizon, morality, locus of authority, form of world coherence, and symbolic function. A new Centers of Value and Quest for Meaning Scale is proposed to assess the aspects, allow non-believers to respond, tap centers of value that are not religious, and eventually address the theoretical assumption of structural wholeness across aspects. In a series of exploratory factor analyses, factors for each adult stage/style emerged for most of the aspects. This supports the potential importance of assessing the aspects and allows for more than one methodology to assess them.},

  abstract={Interest in the psychology of misinformation has exploded in recent years. Despite ample research, to date there is no validated framework to measure misinformation susceptibility. Therefore, we introduce Verificationdone, a nuanced interpretation schema and assessment tool that simultaneously considers Veracity discernment, and its distinct, measurable abilities (real/fake news detection), and biases (distrust/naivite-negative/positive judgment bias). We then conduct three studies with seven independent samples (N-total = 8504) to show how to develop, validate, and apply the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In Study 1 (N = 409) we use a neural network language model to generate items, and use three psychometric methods-factor analysis, item response theory, and exploratory graph analysis-to create the MIST-20 (20 items; completion time < 2 minutes), the MIST-16 (16 items; < 2 minutes), and the MIST-8 (8 items; < 1 minute). In Study 2 (N = 7674) we confirm the internal and predictive validity of the MIST in five national quota samples (US, UK), across 2 years, from three different sampling platforms-Respondi, CloudResearch, and Prolific. We also explore the MIST's nomological net and generate age-, region-, and country-specific norm tables. In Study 3 (N = 421) we demonstrate how the MIST-in conjunction with Verificationdone-can provide novel insights on existing psychological interventions, thereby advancing theory development. Finally, we outline the versatile implementations of the MIST as a screening tool, covariate, and intervention evaluation framework. As all methods are transparently reported and detailed, this work will allow other researchers to create similar scales or adapt them for any population of interest.},

  abstract={Introduction A positive focus on the present, the only time zone which we experience directly and permanently, is at least as relevant as perspectives on the past and future in a balanced time perspective and its relation to wellbeing. Yet, few instruments examining a positive present time perspective exist. Two present-directed concepts, mindfulness and flow, that are intrinsically linked to mental wellbeing were analyzed and used to formulate a present-eudaimonic scale that complements the past and future scales of the balanced time perspective scale. The present study addresses the psychometric properties of the present-eudaimonic scale and the modified balanced time perspective scale. Method 131 participants filled out the present-eudaimonic scale, the balanced time perspective scale, the Zimbardo time perspective inventory, the five facet mindfulness questionnaire - short form, the Swedish flow proneness questionnaire and the mental health continuum - short form. Balanced time perspective was operationalized using the deviation from a balanced time perspective coefficient. Results The present-eudaimonic scale showed good psychometric properties including internal consistency, factor structure, and convergent validity. The present-eudaimonic scale explained an additional eleven percent of variance in mental health beyond the other time perspective scales. Balanced time perspective as measured with the modified balanced time perspective scale correlated significantly stronger with mental health than balanced time perspective measured with the Zimbardo time perspective inventory. Conclusions The present-eudaimonic scale fills a gap in the assessment of time perspective and the modified balanced time perspective scale is a promising way to study balanced time perspective.},

  abstract={Aggressive driving has been found to result in road collisions which are a major cause of injury, fatality and financial cost in motorised countries. Qualitative and survey based studies suggest that drivers use justifications or explanations of their aggressive driving that bear strong resemblance to Bandura's mechanisfns of moral disengagement. The aim of the current study was to explore the applicability of moral disengagement to the driving context using a purpose-adapted scale, the Driving Moral Disengagement Scale. A convenience sample of general drivers (N = 294) responded to an on-line survey comprised of measures of trait anger, driving anger (DAX revised), moral disengagement and driying moral disengagement. Factor analysis allowed for reduction of the new scale from 23 items to 13 items, and this shortened Driving Moral Disengagement Scale (DMDS) had good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha.83). Scree plot criteria indicated a one factor solution accounting for 34.34\% of the variance. Bivariate correlations on the shortened DMDS revealed significant and positive relationships with measures of driving aggression, moral disengagement, trait anger and driving anger, r =.28-.55. Moreover the strength of the association between driving aggression and moral disengagement was greater than that with driving anger. Hierarchical regression revealed driving moral disengagement as the strongest significant predictor of driving aggression, accounting for 18\% of the unique variation in the DV, and suggesting this may be a more useful predictor than driving anger. In addition, significant differences between participants' mean scores for moral disengagement in everyday situations and their driving moral disengagement scores support the interpretation that drivers may behave differently from their `usual' selves when driving, and that the driving context may encourage both greater moral disengagement and greater tendency towards aggressive responses. Chi square analysis indicated that those who scored high on driving moral disengagement were significantly more likely to report aggressive responses to driving situations than those with low driving moral disengagement scores (with a large effect size, (p =.42). This suggests that the DMDS may be useful for future driving aggression research. Implications for intervention are that aiming to alert drivers to their usual self-censure mechanisms or to prevent the tendency to moral disengagement while driving may be effective in reducing driving aggression and the risky or dangerous responses associated with it on road.

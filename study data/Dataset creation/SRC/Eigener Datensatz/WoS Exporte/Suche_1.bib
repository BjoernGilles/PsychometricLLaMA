  abstract={This study explores the personality of Internet media and develops a multidimensional measurement scale to assess personality across diverse entities, including social networking sites, search engines, portals, and shopping sites. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative methods, including exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, the present study identifies a set of 30 personality traits that represent five unique dimensions of Internet media personality: Intelligent, Amusing, Convenient, Sociable, and Confusing. This study found that different pairs of brand and Internet media personality dimensions yield different effects on attitude toward advertising brands. Practical implications for marketers and advertisers, as well as theoretical implications for advertising researchers, are discussed.},

  abstract={In response to criticism of brand personality measures that embrace other aspects besides brand personality, we developed a new brand personality measure consisting of personality items only. Belgian respondents (n = 12,789) participated in a study of 193 brands. The new scale consists of five factors that show an affinity with the Big Five human personality dimensions. Unlike existing scales, this new measure proved to be reliable for between-brand between-category comparisons, for between-brand within-category comparisons, and for between-respondent comparisons. Moreover, the scale showed high test-retest reliability and cross-cultural validity (in the US and nine other European countries). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={To measure the defective aspect of personality that Ortega (The Revolt of the Masses, 1932) terms vulgarity, in association with those whom he called the masses, we developed the Vulgarity Scale in the context of social dilemmas. A 40-item survey was constructed based on Ortega's descriptions of the characteristics of the masses and we administered this in 2 studies, among 200 university students (Study 1) and with 1,000 adults (Study 2). In both studies, factor analysis of the measurements produced subscales on self-closed and arrogant attitudes, which yielded high internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity. Furthermore, results in Study 2 illustrated that the Vulgarity Scale predicted defection in response to social dilemmas.},

  abstract={The present study is an effort to develop an e-tailer personality scale. Subsequently, we check the impacts of e-tailer personality on self-congruity and behavioral intentions such as intention to reshop and intention to recommend. We have followed a traditional scale development method - item generation, purification, and dimension assessment. A structure questionnaire has been used to collect primary data online. A structure equation model was used to analyze the data. This study has developed a e-tailer personality scale of five dimensions: sophistication, competence, excitement, sincerity, and convenience. The results of a structural equation model largely support the propositions that e-tailer personality is positively related to self-congruity. The results also show that e-tailer personality, behavioral intentions and self-congruity are positively related. A comparison of the developed scale with the existing brand personality scales, results in a unique dimension of e-tailer personality scale. Arguably, this study may be seen as a first study in an emerging economy and online retailing domain. The results have both academic and managerial implications.},

Contemporary advertisements and promotional activities by a host of firms demonstrate a managerial belief in the value of establishing a brand personality that mirrors that of branding scholars. Yet extant research has yet to fully evaluate the perceived appeal of brand personality to consumers. This issue is important to managers because it is precisely this level of appeal that influences target consumers' purchase decisions and helps to sustain the endurance of a brand's perceived personality between promotional cycles. This article conceptualizes, develops, and validates measures for assessing a consumer's perception of brand personality appeal (BPA). Three dimensions of BPA (favorability, originality, clarity) emerge and are empirically demonstrated to directly and positively impact consumer purchase intentions.},

  abstract={Personality psychology relies on well-validated measures of individual differences to describe and predict behavior. A newer comprehensive measure, the Inventory of Individual Differences in the Lexicon (IIDL) has been developed, but its ability to predict actual behavior has not been examined. The present article uses the IIDL to predict directly observed behavior, as categorized by the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC). Video recorded interviews with participants in a laboratory setting were coded for directly observable behavior. Forty-eight IIDL items had meaningful associations with the IPC. Most importantly, 25 items provided unique predictive information above and beyond a factor-level measure of personality. This suggests that comprehensive measures of personality should be considered for their additive validity in predicting interpersonal behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The success of a brand relies on the extent to which it differentiates itself from the myriad of competitors. As brands seek to become distinctive, brand personality is viewed as a viable metaphor for understanding consumers' perceptions of brands and for crafting a unique identity in their minds. Measurement and management of brand personality becomes significant in this regard. Most of the existing brand personality scales are either designed to measure the brand personality construct in general or to measure particular categories of brands. There is a lack of a scale which measures the personality of product brands as such. This research tries to fill this lacuna by creating a new product brand personality scale incorporating various advancements in the field of brand personality measurement. This study employs a mixed method approach and the important phases include construct definition, item generation, measure purification, assessment of reliability and validity, and development of a short version of the scale. Findings of this research reconfirm the consumers' tendency to attribute personality characteristics to brands. It also identifies seven dimensions of product brand personality with 26 items.},

CM has been manipulated in experimental studies, but it has not been investigated in field research due to the absence of a scale to measure CM. In study 1, we followed Hinkin's scale development protocol to conceptualize, develop, and validate a measure of CM to facilirate research in organizational contexts. In Study 2, we examined the relationship between CM and measures of performance, counterproductive work behavior (CWB), organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB), and in role-performance (IRP). Results from hierarchical regression analyses indicate that CM is related to these performance outcomes and explains incremental variance over established measures of the Five-Factor Model of personality. Implications for personality research, selection of human resources, and facilitation of an ethical workplace are discussed.},

However, the positive effect of brand personality on donors' intention to engage pro-socially may be affected in cases in which NPOs provide monetary incentives to those donors. Relying on social exchange theory, the authors examine how monetary incentives and brand personality commonly affect the intention to donate and whether this effect varies based on the perceived trustworthiness of the NPO. The results of two experimental studies show that branding and incentivizing decisions should not be developed independently because monetary incentives do indeed undermine the positive effects of brand personality on the intention to donate. However, the effectiveness of incentives varies with the perceived level of trust in the NPO: highly trusted NPO services are harmed by monetary incentives, whereas less-trusted NPOs may even benefit.},

  abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to critique human personality as a theory underpinning brand personality and to propose instead a theory from human perception, and by doing so, to identify universally relevant dimensions.        Design/methodology/approach - A review of published measures of brand personality, a re-analysis of two existing data bases and the analysis of one new database are used to argue and test for the dimensions derived from perception theory.        Findings - Existing work on brand personality suggests 16 separate dimensions for the construct, but some appear common to most measures. When non-orthogonal rotation is used to re-analyse existing trait data on brand personality, three dimensions derived from signalling and associated theory can emerge: sincerity (e.g. warm, friendly and agreeable), competence (e.g. competent, effective and efficient) and status (e.g. prestigious, elegant and sophisticated). The first two are common to most measures, status is not.        Research limitations/implications - Three dimensions derived from signalling and associated theory are proposed as generic, relevant to all contexts and cultures. They can be supplemented by context specific dimensions.        Practical implications - Measures of these three dimensions should be included in all measures of brand personality.        Originality/value - Prior work on brand personality has focussed on identifying apparently new dimensions for the construct. While most work is not theoretically based, some have argued for the relevance of human personality. That model is challenged, and an alternative approach to both theory and analysis is proposed and successfully tested.},

Two scoring schemes based on this approach strongly differentiated between scores obtained under honest vs directed faking conditions in cross-validation samples (r(pb)=.45 and .67). This approach is shown to successfully classify between 20% and 37% of faked personality measures with only a 1% false positive rate in a sample comprised of 56% honest responses. Of equal importance, this method does not result in a scale that meaningfully correlates with personality or cognitive ability tests. This study raises many questions about both the source and generalizabiltiy of the effect. Key directions for future research and improved scale development that may limit or enhance the utility of the idiosyncratic item-response method are discussed.},

  abstract={The literature suggests that contextualized personality measures yield stronger predictive validity. However, frame-of-reference (FOR) theory is underdeveloped, and existing work-FOR personality measures have several limitations. Integrating FOR research with the knowledge-and-appraisal personality architecture (KAPA) theoretical framework, we developed a new work-FOR personality measure: the 20-item ORG-B5. Study 1 summarizes the procedure used to select the items and tests its basic psychometric properties with two samples. Study 2 shows that the ORG-B5 has good convergent and discriminant validity and outperforms the Mini-Markers and the Mini-IPIP in its base psychometrics. Study 3 demonstrates that the ORG-B5 predicts work-engagement and leader-member exchange (LMX), while Study 4a and 4b shows incremental validity of the ORG-B5 above other Big Five measures in predicting work-engagement and LMX. Study 5 demonstrates measurement invariance between native and nonnative English speakers and compares the criterion and incremental validity of the ORG-B5 beyond another work-FOR measure. Study 6 demonstrates convergence between self- and coworker ratings of the ORG-B5 and its prediction of time-lagged self-reported engagement and LMX and supervisor-reported deviance and task performance. Given these results, we argue that the ORG-B5 is a reliable and short personality measure more appropriate than existing measures for organizational research.},

Overall, the findings revealed good internal consistency, convergent, discriminant, concurrent and predictive validity, and adequate measurement invariance. Potential applications for the adaptability scale are discussed.},

Scale development process resulted in an 11-item Consciousness of Social Face (CSF) scale made up of the following two correlated dimensions: desire to gain face and fear of losing face. The two-factor correlated structure of CSF scale was stable across multiple samples of both students and non-students subjects. The construct validity of CSF scale, including convergent validity, discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity was also demonstrated by examining relationships with other personality or demographical variables.},

Criterion validity was supported by significant negative associations with substance use coping but not enhancement motives. Study 2 (N = 823), extended the results of the initial factor analysis, indicating that the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) contains four first-order factors, which are indicators of a single second-order general distress tolerance factor. Study 2 indicated that the DTS was stable over a 6-month interval and the DTS was prospectively associated with alcohol problems among men. In both studies, males reported significantly higher levels of distress tolerance than women.},

  abstract={The Global Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJWS) has been widely used in measuring the Belief in a Just World (BJW) personality trait. Despite its widespread application across the social sciences, the validity of this scale has not been sufficiently tested in the literature. In this research, the authors examine the internal and external validity of the GBJWS using both standard correlational analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). Specifically, the authors test the concurrent validity, internal consistency, uni-dimensional structure, convergent validity, and both measurement and latent mean invariance of the scale across gender and culture. The results of a pilot study suggest strong concurrent validity of the GBJWS with other BJW scales, and the findings of the two main studies support the internal and external validity of GBJWS across gender and culture. The authors' results further show an overall greater level of BJW of Chinese individuals compared to Americans. The present research provides a much needed investigation of the validity of the GBJWS, and answers calls for research examining the scale's utility across different populations.

  abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to existing models of human motivation by measuring transcendental needs along with the more commonly studied basic and social needs in order to take into account the multitude of needs experienced in the workplace.        Design/methodology/approach A survey combining the Big Five Inventory (John and Srivastava, 1999) with the authors' 30-item need-level questionnaire was administered to 366 participants (162 males, 204 females). The authors examined the relation between need levels, particularly transcendental needs, and personality to detect the predictors of the different personality traits.        Findings The results showed that extraversion (r=0.24; p<0.001) and agreeableness (r=0.19; p<0.001) are predicted by high social needs, whereas openness to experience is predicted by high transcendental needs (r=0.35; p<0.001). While the authors made no hypotheses about conscientiousness and neuroticism, they found that neuroticism was significantly correlated with transcendental needs (r=-0.15; p<0.01).        Research limitations/implications The relations between needs and other individual dimensions, such as values or interests, could be further examined. The nature of the sample could be extended in additional studies.        Practical implications Since need levels were able to predict personality traits, measuring need levels instead of personality could be a better predictor of both adaptability and performance in specific contexts.        Social implications In a position that requires a specific vocation and sense of purpose (priest, counselor, etc.), transcendental needs could be a better predictor of job achievement than personality traits. Monitoring all levels of needs could also be valuable in helping managers develop a deeper understanding of their team members' expectations for meaning and purpose.        Originality/value This research contributes to the model on human motivation by adding one more level (transcendental) and by testing the hypothesis of a link between a need scale and personality traits.},

  abstract={The service literature, in addressing constructs predicting customer behaviors during service delivery, has neglected the domain of customers' irrational beliefs (IBs). The Customer Irrational Beliefs Scale (CIBS) was constructed in a mixed-methods process of scale development and validation - with five separate customer samples, in which the final stage employs the scale to predict customer behaviors of ingratiation, assertiveness, social benefits, commitment, and loyalty. The customer irrational beliefs (CIB) construct comprises three different reflective indicators: Subjective Favoritism, Absolute Fairness, and Reasoning Supremacy. CIB predicted customer behaviors of ingratiation, assertiveness, and customer-related outcomes such as commitment and loyalty. This work extends theory in conceptualizing customer IBs in service interactions. Insights derived from the CIBS can help service employees be cognizant of what thoughts underlie unusual customer behavior with the prospect of dealing more effectively with it.},

  abstract={We propose a framework for integrating various modern natural language processing (NLP) models to assist researchers with developing valid psychological scales. Transformer-based deep neural networks offer state-of-the-art performance on various natural language tasks. This project adapts the transformer model GPT-2 to learn the structure of personality items, and generate the largest openly available pool of personality items, consisting of one million new items. We then use that artificial intelligence-based item pool (AI-IP) to provide a subset of potential scale items for measuring a desired construct. To better recommend construct-related items, we train a paired neural network-based classification BERT model to predict the observed correlation between personality items using only their text. We also demonstrate how zero-shot models can help balance desired content domains within the scale. In combination with the Al-IP, these models narrow the large item pool to items most correlated with a set of initial items. We demonstrate the ability of this multimodel framework to develop longer cohesive scales from a small set of construct-relevant items. We found reliability, validity, and fit equivalent for AI-assisted scales compared to scales developed and optimized by traditional methods. By leveraging neural networks' ability to generate text relevant to a given topic and infer semantic similarity, this project demonstrates how to support creative and open-ended elements of the scale development process to increase the likelihood of one's initial scale being valid, and minimize the need to modify and revalidate the scale.},

The construct of active procrastination has a high potential to expand the time management literature and is likely to be adopted by researchers in multiple areas of psychology. To facilitate the research on this new construct and its further integration into the literature, the authors developed and validated a new, expanded measure of active procrastination that reliably assesses its four dimensions. Using this new measure of active procrastination, they further examined its nomological network. The new 16-item measure is a critical step toward further empirical investigation of active procrastination.},

  abstract={It has recently been demonstrated that metrics of structural validity are severely underreported in social and personality psychology. We comprehensively assessed structural validity in a uniquely large and varied data set (N = 144,496 experimental sessions) to investigate the psychometric properties of some of the most widely used self-report measures (k = 15 questionnaires, 26 scales) in social and personality psychology. When the scales were assessed using the modal practice of considering only internal consistency, 88% of them appeared to possess good validity. Yet when validity was assessed comprehensively (via internal consistency, immediate and delayed test-retest reliability, factor structure, and measurement invariance for age and gender groups), only 4% demonstrated good validity. Furthermore, the less commonly a test was reported in the literature, the more likely the scales were to fail that test (e.g., scales failed measurement invariance much more often than internal consistency). This suggests that the pattern of underreporting in the field may represent widespread hidden invalidity of the measures used and may therefore pose a threat to many research findings. We highlight the degrees of freedom afforded to researchers in the assessment and reporting of structural validity and introduce the concept of validity hacking (v-hacking), similar to the better-known concept of p-hacking. We argue that the practice of v-hacking should be acknowledged and addressed.},

  abstract={More than 70 years ago, Maslow put forward an integrated theory of human motivation that still captures the public imagination. Still, integration with modern theory and research remains elusive. The current study aims to fill this gap in the psychological literature, linking Maslow's theory to contemporary theory and research on personality and well-being. Toward this aim, the new 30-item "Characteristics of Self-Actualization Scale (CSAS)" was developed. Scale validation showed that 10 characteristics of self-actualizing people as proposed by Maslow load on a general factor of self-actualization and demonstrate external validity. Those reporting more characteristics of self-actualization were more motivated by growth, exploration, and love of humanity than the fulfillment of deficiencies in basic needs. The characteristics of self-actualization were also associated with greater well-being across a number of indicators of well-being, including greater life satisfaction, self-acceptance, positive relations, environmental mastery, personal growth, autonomy, purpose in life, and self-transcendent experiences. Self-actualization scores also predicted work-related outcomes and creativity across multiple domains of achievement. The results provide support for Maslow's proposed characteristics of self-actualization and basic motivational framework, bringing the concept of self-actualization so frequently discussed by the founding humanistic psychologists firmly into the 21st century.},

Participants were N = 920 Australian adults (502 females) who completed an online survey (N = 510 of whom participated in a follow-up survey). In addition to the REIm, participants completed a Big Five personality measure. The internal consistency of the REIm-13 was acceptable given the limited number of items (.52-.68). Furthermore, test-retest reliability was high (rho = .64-.74) for the theorized four-factor and two-factor solutions. Construct validity was established by examining the relationship between short-form and full REIm factors (rho = .65-.71), and the validity of composite scoring was confirmed against factor scoring. Relationship with age (a slight negative relationship to both main scales), gender (females reporting higher Experientiality, males higher Rationality), and Big Five variables largely followed previous findings, demonstrating concurrent validity. The study demonstrates that the REIm-13 provides sound measurement of thinking style.},

  abstract={The present study aimed to develop an instrument to measure emotional intelligence (EI). This novel scale distinguishes between four factors, namely, self- and other-focused emotion appraisal and emotion regulation. In Study 1, the Rotterdam Emotional Intelligence Scale (REIS) was developed and examined with respect to its factorial structure and reliability (N = 383). In Study 2, the factorial structure of the REIS was validated in two new samples (N = 2728 and N = 590). Study 3 examined convergent and discriminant validity by comparing the REIS dimensions with other EI instruments, cognitive intelligence, and personality (N = 108 and N = 105). The criterion validity of the REIS was examined in Study 4 (N = 73, N = 95, and N = 103). The results indicate that the REIS follows a four-factorial structure and can be reliably measured with 28 items. The REIS was strongly correlated with other self-reported EI instruments and weakly to moderately correlated with an ability EI test, cognitive intelligence, and personality. Moreover, self-focused emotion regulation was negatively associated with tutors' perceived stress, whereas other-focused emotion regulation was positively associated with tutors' work engagement, jobseekers' other-rated interview performance, and leaders' transformational leadership style.},

  abstract={Researchers have developed measures of trait self-control, or one's general tendency to have self-control. However, measures that provide insight into state self-control, or self-control for specific behaviors, are lacking. The current research addresses this gap for trackable activities, or behaviors an actor monitors over time with the goal of engaging in an acceptable amount of the behavior (e.g., eating, shopping). The authors develop multi item perceptual measures of standards, monitoring capacity, and monitoring, three factors that contribute to self-control for these types of behaviors, as well as a measure of state self-control that can be used in conjunction with these measures. Seven studies support the measures' reliability and validity and demonstrate the measures' adaptability to a variety of trackable activities, including eating, shopping, drinking, smoking, and gambling. The measures provide a tool for researchers seeking to gain insight into self-control for specific behaviors, with practical implications for policymakers, marketers, and managers.},

However, prior research has failed to clearly conceptualize learning agility and to empirically clarify its dimensions. MethodWe developed the Leadership Learning Agility Scale (LLAS) by using a combination of both deductive and inductive approaches and established scale development and validation procedures. We administered the LLAS among three independent samples of workers and leaders (N = 907; N = 196; N = 219). ResultsOur results indicate that our 18-item LLAS measures the willingness to learn from social experiences, and the drive to apply those lessons in new and challenging leadership roles, and comprises a Developing Leadership, Seeking Feedback, and Developing Systematically dimension. Furthermore, the LLAS showed adequate internal consistency. Leadership learning agility was positively related to achievement motivation, extraversion, and conscientiousness but unrelated to openness to experience. DiscussionWe provided a new scale to measure leadership learning agility that can be applied in both research and practitioner settings.},

  abstract={Individuals often identify with groups in order to either reduce perceived uncertainty or to feel better about who they are as individuals. This suggests that cognitive and affective identification are two distinctive forms of social identification in organizational settings. Because neurotic individuals are highly motivated to reduce perceived uncertainty, they will tend to identify cognitively with groups. Extraverted individuals, on the other hand, are highly motivated to enhance how they feel about themselves and thus identify affectively with groups. Across three studies, we develop measures of cognitive and affective identification and then show that neuroticism is positively related to cognitive identification, whereas extraversion is positively related to affective identification. We also find that affective identification provides incremental predictive validity over and above cognitive identification in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational involvement, and organizational citizenship behaviors.

  abstract={Psychometric review of 33 peer-reviewed studies of six self-report emotional intelligence (EI) measures supports a multidimensional conceptualization, of EI. The nature and number of EI facets, however, and their distinctiveness from more established trait domains is unclear. Building on earlier efforts, three studies were undertaken (Ns = 138, 163, 152) to develop self-report measures of 10 facets of EI proposed by Salovey and Mayer (1990). Results support the reliability (internal consistency, test-retest) and validity (content, criterion, construct, structural) of the proposed scales and their distinctiveness among themselves and with respect to more established trait domains (e.g., personality). Specifically, three satisfaction and four cross-cultural adaptability facets were predicted uniquely by 9 of the 10 proposed subscales, controlling for social desirability, the Big Five, positive and negative affect, and self-monitoring. All told, results confirm that trait-EI can self-report and conceptualized as a distinct multidimensional domain.},

This research presents the development and validation of workplace compassion scale. The scale development process consisted of four studies with a total sample of 947 respondents. In study 1, we developed the items for the new measure, by considering the four-factor conceptualization of organizational compassion. Study 2 and 3 focuses on item purification and testing the model fit indices of the proposed scale. In study 4, we followed a time separated design to test the nomological network and discriminant validity of the workplace compassion scale. The final workplace compassion scale consists of 12 items that measure other-oriented/expressed compassion in the workplace. The scale is beneficial for providing impetus to future quantitative research in organizational compassion.},

Findings Results suggest that our proposed CRP scale is internally consistent (reliable) and valid in that it is conceptually distinct from, yet empirically correlated with neighboring constructs such as affective commitment to change, readiness for change and proactive personality. Originality/value The deductive nature of our study resulted in a comprehensive and domain-specific scale assessing recipients' proactive responses to organizational change efforts. This opens doors to empirical studies on examining the conditions under which change recipients "may" step outside the boundaries of passivity to respond positively and proactivity to organizational change efforts.},

Confirmatory factor analyses show that a correlated six-factor model with two higher order factors of internal and external networking fits the data well. We provide evidence for construct and criterion-oriented validity, showing that the internal and external networking scales exhibit meaningful correlational patterns with personality, career, and social network variables but only small and mostly nonsignificant correlations with measures of job or task characteristics.},

  abstract={Interdependence is a fundamental characteristic of social interactions. Interdependence Theory states that 6 dimensions describe differences between social situations. Here we examine if these 6 dimensions describe how people think about their interdependence with others in a situation. We find that people (in situ and ex situ) can reliably differentiate situations according to 5, but not 6, dimensions of interdependence: (a) mutual dependence, (b) power, (c) conflict, (d) future interdependence, and (e) information certainty. This model offers a unique framework for understanding how people think about social situations compared to another recent model of situation construal (DIAMONDS). Furthermore, we examine factors that are theorized to shape perceptions of interdependence, such as situational cues (e.g., nonverbal behavior) and personality (e.g., HEXACO and Social Value Orientation). We also study the implications of subjective interdependence for emotions and cooperative behavior during social interactions. This model of subjective interdependence explains substantial variation in the emotions people experience in situations (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, and disgust), and explains 24% of the variance in cooperation, above and beyond the DIAMONDS model. Throughout these studies, we develop and validate a multidimensional measure of subjective outcome interdependence that can be used in diverse situations and relationships-the Situational Interdependence Scale (SIS). We discuss how this model of interdependence can be used to better understand how people think about social situations encountered in close relationships, organizations, and society.},

We report on the development and validation of a scale to measure trait (character-based) appraisal self-respect (ASR), conceptualised as a disposition to perceive or appraise oneself as being a respectworthy honourable person. We tested the factor structure, reliability, convergent, discriminant and criterion validity of the ASR scale in samples of adult individuals (combined N = 1910 across samples). The resulting ASR scale was found to be essentially unidimensional and showed good internal and acceptable test-retest reliability. Trait ASR was correlated with (yet distinct from) theoretically related measures of global self-esteem, moral self and principledness, and was distinct from other self-esteem facets not based on honourable character traits. Importantly, it related to well-being and prosocial behaviour over-and-above self-esteem. The validation work served to consolidate the theoretical boundaries and utility of this important concept.},

  abstract={This article reports on the development and preliminary empirical testing of two new scales designed to assess workaholic behavioral patterns. One scale assessed employee tendencies to perform nonrequired work (typically, spending time thinking of ways to perform work better), and the other measured tendencies to intrude on and attempt to control the work of others. These scales seem consistent with both conceptual definitions and anecdotal accounts of workaholism. Moreover, the scales were designed to assess behavioral tendencies rather than work attitudes, to circumvent the possibility of rationalization and denial among workaholic respondents, and to be applicable across multiple work contexts. Evidence from a sample of 278 employed respondents indicated that the scales were internally consistent, and represented distinct constructs. The scales also demonstrated evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. For example, scores on the nonrequired work scale correlated positively with hours worked and with the needs for achievement, autonomy, and affiliation. Scores on the control of others scale correlated positively with job involvement, stress, work-nonwork conflict, role conflict, dominance needs, and self-monitoring, In summary, the workaholism scales developed for this investigation appear both reliable and valid and thus potentially able to shed light on the phenomenon of workaholism.},

  abstract={This paper aims to conceptualise consumer's luxury brand attachment by developing and validating a psychometric scale through five studies. Study 1 generates and selects potential scale items through literature review, thesaurus search, and expert surveys. Study 2 reduces the items and assesses the dimensionality of the scale. Study 3 validates the dimensionality of the scale. Next, study 4 assesses the four types of validities (convergent, discriminate, predictive, and nomological) for the scale. Finally, study 5 examines two behavioural indicators of luxury brand attachment. The results show a parsimonious seven-item luxury brand attachment scale. The studies confirm that there are major differences among luxury brand attachment, emotional attachments to brands, and the brand attitude scales. Besides, this research demonstrates that the luxury brand attachment is a unique construct that captures the essence of consumers' emotional connection with luxury brands. The development and validation of luxury brand attachment scale fulfil an important gap in the luxury branding literature. The scale will provide meaningful insights for the luxury practitioners. The luxury brand attachment scale provides an improved measure and better understanding of consumer's attachment to the luxury brands which was not accurately measured by using general attachment scales in past studies.},

The method, which integrates theoretical and empirical steps, is applied in the context of the construct of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), using data from six different samples (N=1284) collected across Europe. Alternative representations of the trait EI variance, derived from the outcome variables used in previous validation studies of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, were regressed on the 15 trait EI facets using the stepwise method. The analyses revealed five facets, which did not occupy unique construct variance in any of the six samples. As expected, a composite of the remaining 10 facets consistently showed greater construct validity than the original 15-facet composite. Implications for construct and scale development are discussed, and directions for further validation of the method and for its application to other constructs are provided. (c) 2014 The Authors.

  abstract={This study introduced an individual difference construct of willingness to compromise and examined its implications for understanding and predicting career-related decisions in work settings. In Study 1 (N = 53), critical incidents of career decisions were analyzed to identify commonalities across different types of career-related compromises. In Study 2 (N = 171), an initial 17-item scale was developed and revised. In Study 3 (N = 201), the convergent and criterion-related validity of the scale was examined in relation to specific personality traits, regret, dealing with uncertainty, career adaptability, and a situational dilemma task. Willingness to compromise was negatively related to neuroticism, and positively related to dealing with uncertainty, openness to experience, and career adaptability; it also predicted responses to the situational dilemma task. Results provided support for the reliability and validity of the scale.},

This paper describes two studies designed to develop (Study 1) and provide initial validation (Study 2) for a new measure specifically designed to assist in this context: the Occupational Performance Assessment-Response Distortion (OPerA-RD) scale. This 20-item scale is contextualized to the workplace and was developed by identifying items that could detect over- and under-reporting of job performance by self- or other-report in four independent faking samples. Initial validation of the OPerA-RD was supported by expected differences between within-group faking and control conditions in subsequent samples, specifically over- and under-reporting of job performance by self- or other-reports. Implications for research and applied settings are discussed.},

Confirmatory factor analyses with a calibration and a cross-validation sample (total N = 930) showed that four recovery experiences can be differentiated: psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery, and control (Study 2). Examination of the nomological net in a subsample of Study 2 (N = 271) revealed moderate relations of the recovery experiences with measures of job stressors and psychological well-being; relations with coping and personality variables were generally low (Study 3).

  abstract={The purpose of this investigation is to develop and validate a short form of the Generalized Ethnocentrism Scale (GENE). The GENE scale measures people's tendency to consider their culture as the center of the world. A total of four studies were conducted using samples of college students. In the Study I has been examined the underlying factor structure of the GENE measure. Based on this study, the Short Form Generalized Ethnocentrism Scale is proposed (SFGENE-7). In the second study, the two-factor structure evidenced in Study I , was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The psychometric properties of the short form of the GENE scale were also satisfactory. In the third study, the two-factor structure was submitted again to CFA. The investigation of the relationship between ethnocentrism and external variables was also examined. The results supported the convergent, discriminant and incremental validities. Finally, in the fourth study, temporal stability of the short form of the GENE scale has been assessed. The results demonstrated that the SFGENE-7 had adequate test-retest reliability. Overall, results reveal that the SFGENE-7 has adequate levels of reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and incremental validity. We obtained a short, reliable, and valid instrument to assess ethnocentrism.},

  abstract={Past research has predominantly used the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale total score to indicate career adaptability and found promising evidence for the importance of career adaptability. However, there remains a critical gap between the research popularity and the incremental validity of the CAAS total score, which concerns its additive predictions for career criteria beyond general self-efficacy. To solidify the empirical foundation of career adaptability, we used a sample of employees (n = 284) and a sample of students (n = 279) to examine the incremental predictions of the CAAS total score for career adaptation responses and results over and beyond general self-efficacy. The results revealed that while the CAAS total score additively predicted career decision self-efficacy over and beyond general self-efficacy in students, the CAAS total score demonstrated no or little additive predictions for occupational self-efficacy, career decision self-efficacy, career decision ambiguity aversion, career satisfaction, major satisfaction, and career indecision over and beyond general self-efficacy. We discussed the implications of this study for adaptability research, assessment, and practice together with the limitations and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract={Objectives: The research investigating how one's multiple cultural identities are configured within the self has yet to account for existing cultural identity configurations aside from integration, and for identifying with more than 2 cultural groups at once. The current research addresses these issues by constructing the Multicultural Identity Integration Scale (MULTIIS) to examine 3 different multicultural identity configurations, and their relationship to well-being based on Amiot and colleagues' (2007) cognitive-developmental model of social identity integration (CDSMII). Method: Diverse samples of multicultural individuals completed the MULTIIS along with identity and well-being measures. (Study 1A: N = 407; 1B: N = 310; 2A = 338 and 2A = 254) Results: Reliability and confirmatory factorial analyses (Studies 1A and 2A) all supported the factorial structure of the MULTIIS. Regression analyses (Studies 1B and 2B) confirmed that the integration subscale of the MULTIIS positively predicted well-being, whereas compartmentalization negatively predicted well-being. Categorization was inconsistently related to well-being. Conclusions: These findings support the CDSMII and the usefulness of the MULTIIS measure, and suggest that each identity configuration is uniquely related to well-being outcomes.},

  abstract={Marital infidelity is both socially perceived as immoral and very frequent. This contradiction might be explained through the process of moral disengagement, specifically by the use of certain socially shared moral justifications of infidelity, which consequently foster unfaithful behavior. This research developed and examined the Infidelity Moral Disengagement Scale (IMDS), aiming to capture the strategies of morally legitimizing infidelity used among people in marital relationships. Across two studies (total N = 609 married participants) we investigated the dimensions and psychometric properties of the IMDS. Results showed that the dominant strategies of legitimizing marital infidelity are the diffusion of responsibility, the attribution of blame on the cheated partner, advantageous comparisons with other immoral acts, justifying infidelity through certain benefits, and minimizing its negative consequences. The IMDS emerged as negatively related to moral identity and strongly associated to people???s past infidelity and to their tendency to engage in unfaithful behaviors.},

  abstract={Morality-as-Cooperation (MAC) is the theory that morality is a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. MAC uses game theory to identify distinct types of cooperation, and predicts that each will be considered morally relevant, and each will give rise to a distinct moral domain. Here we test MAC's predictions by developing a new self-report measure of morality, the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and comparing its psychometric properties to those of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). Over four studies, the results support the MAC-Q's seven-factor model of morality, but not the MFQ's five-factor model. Thus MAC emerges as the best available compass with which to explore the moral landscape. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract={Although research has demonstrated that narcissistic, contingent, and unsubstantiated forms of self-esteem correlate with undesirable behavior patterns, other researchers have searched for prosocial forms of belief in one's worth. Universal worth is proposed as the belief that (a) one is valued by a deity; (b) one's value is not contingent on success or failure; and (c) one is not valued by a deity more or less than others are valued. The Universal Worth Scale (UWS) was developed to measure this set of beliefs. Psychometric analyses showed that UWS scores were both internally consistent and temporally stable. Although scores on this scale were correlated with measures of constructs that were expected to be associated, the pattern of correlations suggests that UWS scores measure a distinct construct. Future research is suggested to explore universal worth in relation to sociometer theory and terror management theory, and within the continued search for prosocial foundations of self-worth.},

Design/methodology/approach Using four independent samples of employed adults, we developed a short and long version of the Coachability Scale. We followed standard scale development practices, presenting evidence of the scales' factor structure, reliability and validity. Findings With the first two samples, we derived an initial three-dimensional version of the Coachability Scale and provided evidence of convergent validity. With Samples 3 and 4, we expanded the scale with additional dimensions related to coaching feedback processes and accumulated additional evidence of the scale's validity, and provided evidence of convergence between the two versions of the Coachability Scale. Research limitations/implications We encourage continued research on the Coachability Scale, as well as research on coachability in formal coaching relationships and with more diverse populations and cultures. It is also important to examine how coachability relates to specific coachee behaviors and outcomes. Although common method bias may be a limitation, we used temporally separated measurements to minimize method bias in Sample 4. Practical implications Knowledge about coachability can inform coaching practice decisions and help tailor the coaching engagement to better fit the coachee's needs. Social implications Measuring how individuals respond to coaching and coaching relationships has important implications for managerial behavior and the quality of work life. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to develop valid scales for assessing workplace coachability.},

Drawing on a communication-based approach to leadership and following a theoretical framework of interpersonal communication processes in organizations, this article describes the development and validation of a one-dimensional 6-item scale in four studies (total N = 604). Results from Study 1 and 2 provide evidence for the internal consistency and factorial validity of the PLCQ's self-rating version (PLCQ-SR)-a version for measuring how leaders perceive their own communication with their followers. Results from Study 3 and 4 show internal consistency, construct validity, and criterion validity of the PLCQ's other-rating version (PLCQ-OR)-a version for measuring how followers perceive the communication of their leaders. Cronbach's alpha had an average of.80 over the four studies. All confirmatory factor analyses yielded good to excellent model fit indices. Convergent validity was established by average positive correlations of.69 with subdimensions of transformational leadership and leader-member exchange scales. Furthermore, nonsignificant correlations with socially desirable responding indicated discriminant validity. Last, criterion validity was supported by a moderately positive correlation with job satisfaction (r =.31).},

  abstract={Both individuals and organizations benefit when workers can effectively cope with stressors in the work and family domains. This study takes an inductive approach to the development of a work stressor coping scale and a family stressor coping scale.        In phase one, a comprehensive list of coping strategies was generated through a multi-step content analysis of qualitative interviews. In phase two, the content validity of the work stressor and family stressor coping strategy scales was established using data from three samples; and in phase three, convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity evidence were obtained using data from two samples.        A multi-step content analysis of qualitative interview data was used to develop a list of 365 coping strategy statements (182 work and 183 family) representing 11 work and 14 family stressor coping strategies. Multiple samples were used to reduce the number of scale items, and establish evidence for the scales' content, construct, and criterion-related validity. The final work stressor coping scale consisted of 36 items assessing 12 different strategies, and the final family stressor coping scale consisted of 45 items assessing 15 different strategies.        Findings from the present study suggest that individuals may use a wider variety of strategies to cope with work stressors and family stressors than previously thought, and these strategies may be differentially effective depending on the stressor domain (i.e., work or family) and outcome (e.g., work-to-family conflict vs. family-to-work conflict).        The inductive nature of our study resulted in a comprehensive and domain-specific scales assessing how individuals cope with work stressors and family stressors.},

Using an exploratory factor analysis, we found support for a two-dimensional factor structure, with the first factor reflecting rule relativity beliefs (i.e. the belief that rules should guide rather than dictate behavior) and the second reflecting beliefs about the purpose and idealized nature of rules. Construct validity was tested by exploring whether the two factors correlate with hypothetical rule-breaking behavior. We found that only the first dimension (rule relativity beliefs) was strongly associated with rule-breaking. We discuss the importance of constructive rule beliefs in understanding a range of rulerelated behaviors.},

This is, in part, due to the lack of an appropriate measure capable of capturing power and status as distinct constructs. In order to advance research on social hierarchy and bridge the empirical findings from social psychology research to organizational research, this paper outlines the development of a 12-item bipartite measure of perceived power and perceived status. Using seven samples, we develop a psychometrically sound measure and provide evidence of construct validity. Our results not only support the importance of distinguishing between these two prevalent bases of social hierarchy, but also highlight the potential dangers of capturing one base of hierarchy without accounting for the other.},

  abstract={Brands have become increasingly important as a foundation for competitive strategy. Unfortunately, although brand managers are responsible for brand strategy development and execution, little is known about what makes a brand manager effective. A model is developed to understand what intangible capital embodied by brand managers influences brand management capabilities and resultant brand performance. Measures of brand manager intangible capital and brand management capabilities are developed through an iterative scale development process. Hypothesis testing, derived from a survey of brand managers, indicates that brand manager human, relational and informational capital influences brand management capabilities and resultant brand performance, and brand manager intangible capital has an indirect effect on brand performance via brand management capabilities. By delineating and operationalizing the intangible capital and capabilities of brand managers, this study provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for future research on brand managers, tools for assessing current brand manager capital and capabilities, and guidance in relation to intangible capital and capabilities needed by brand managers.

The scale is based on the integrative mindset (Ade, Schuster, Harinck, & Trotschel, 2018), which describes a set of three inclinations of parties approaching negotiations: a collaborative, a curious, and a creative one. Using a first sample (N = 1,030) of online survey participants, we provide evidence for a high psychometric quality of the SIM as suggested by high reliabilities and good fit indices. We also compare the SIM with scales that measure well-known and possibly related psychological constructs and show the SIM's distinction to them. Using a second sample (N = 417), we show how the SIM differs from a Scale on Inappropriate Negotiation Strategies (SINS) that has been used in previous negotiation research. The findings of the present studies are discussed with respect to potential applications of the SIM in experimental research.},

  abstract={Consumers are increasingly confronted with complex processes and technologies as part of their daily consumption. This difficulty, in turn, can hinder their experience and may have negative consequences in terms of satisfaction, word of mouth, and repurchase behaviors. Although companies often offer customer assistance, many consumers do not make the step to ask for help. In this research, we introduce a social psychological framework centered around the threats associated with help-seeking to better explain help-avoidant behaviors. Doing so, we introduce and develop the "propensity to avoid seeking assistance" construct to better understand what triggers and hinders customers' assistance request behavior - or lack thereof. By offering and validating a new scale to measure such behavior, this research adds a methodological contribution to the literature. It also contributes to better explain the behavior of customers who would rather abandon using a product or service than ask for help.},

This may be due to measurement issues, such as the widespread use of Rotter's (1966) general locus of control scale, which is not domain specific. Not surprisingly, Rotter's scale has been shown to be multidimensional, including personal efficacy. When the first Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I) was constructed in the late 1990s, a measure of locus of control was included. Unfortunately, this scale was also multidimensional. Thus, measurement of the construct may be problematic. Because locus of control continues to be important in organizational research, where it has been found to influence intentions, motivation, satisfaction, and performance, we examined the PSED I dataset to determine whether we could develop a more robust measure after the fact. To this end, we constructed a unidimensional locus of control scale using the sample of nascent entrepreneurs in the PSED I dataset and validated the scale using two additional samples.},

The results provided support for a 2-factor conceptualization of the construct, with the dimensions imaginative fantasy and creative fantasy. Imaginative fantasy refers to vivid imagination and absorption in these images and daydreams. Creative fantasy refers to the activity of using fantasy to create new ideas. The trait measure showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discriminant and convergent construct validity, as well as incremental validity. Moreover, in 3 behavioral studies, we put fantasy scores in relationship with behavioral data to provide further proof of validity. A comprehensive measure of fantasy can contribute to our understanding of individual differences in inner experiences, creative processes, and problem solving.},

Job desperation is defined as a state of despair in which a person feels pressure to find a new job, has a negative evaluation of his/her current employment situation, and will go to extreme lengths to find a new job. Using self-determination theory, we provide a theoretical rationale for job desperation. Across two studies, we developed and validated the job desperation scale (JDS). In Study 1, we generated a pool of items and evaluated them using a combination of psychometric techniques including item response theory. In Study 2, we examined the construct validity of the JDS. Results suggest that job desperation is a strong predictor of job search behavior, predicting unique variance in job search behavior over and above other relevant antecedents such as financial strain and job insecurity. We believe job desperation adds to and expands our knowledge of the antecedents of job search behavior by serving as a unique and relevant explanation for why people search for jobs.},

However, there is as yet no measure that distinguishes between these two components of trust. In three studies, we examined the psychometrics of a proposed two-dimensional measure of trust that encompasses propensity to trust and other-focused trust components. To test discriminant validity, we also administered measures of personality, personal self-esteem, social capital, propensity to like people, perceived social support, as well as general and personal beliefs in a just world. Factor analyses supported the proposed two-factor model for the new trust measure. Further analyses supported the difference between these measures.},

  abstract={Scholarly interest in employee voice behavior has increased dramatically over the past 15 years. Although this research has produced valuable knowledge, it has focused almost exclusively on voice as a positively intended challenge to the status quo, even though some scholars have argued that it need not challenge the status quo or be well intentioned. Thus, in this paper, we create an expanded view of voice; one that extends beyond voice as a positively intended challenge to the status quo to include voice that supports how things are being done in organizations as well as voice that may not be well intentioned. We construct a framework based on this expanded view that identifies 4 different types of voice behavior (supportive, constructive, defensive, and destructive). We then develop and validate survey measures for each of these. Evidence from 5 studies across 4 samples provides strong support for our new measures in that (a) a 4-factor confirmatory factor analysis model fit the data significantly better than 1-, 2-, or 3-factor models; (b) the voice measures converged with and yet remained distinct from conceptually related comparison constructs; (c) personality predictors exhibited unique patterns of relationships with the different types of voice; (d) variations in actual voice behaviors had a direct causal impact on responses to the survey items; and (e) each type of voice significantly impacted important outcomes for voicing employees (e. g., likelihood of relying on a voicing employee's opinions and evaluations of a voicing employee's overall performance). Implications of our findings are discussed.},

While prior work has examined how situational factors contribute to these discrepancies, the present work takes an individual differences approach. We developed a new tool to measure a novel construct we call "moxie" to assess individual differences in motivation intensity. Seven studies were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the proposed Moxie Scale. A single factor structure was demonstrated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and the Moxie Scale was shown to have high internal consistency and strong test-retest reliability. Convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity were established by exploring associations between moxie and the Big Five personality traits, as well as related motivational constructs such as grit, self-control, volition and inhibition systems, and procrastination. Moxie also predicted intrinsic and extrinsic motivation above other motivational constructs. Finally, moxie predicted goal achievement over time and mediational analyses indicated that this occurred because those high in moxie invested more resources into their goal. Collectively, these findings suggest that moxie is an important and distinct motivational construct and offer new insights regarding individual differences in motivational intensity.},

Results showed that the WSSE inventory had a four-factor structure (social gathering, performance in public contexts, conflict management, and seeking and offering help), high internal consistency, excellent convergent and discriminant validity, and meaningful correlation patterns with related constructs in the nomological network. Furthermore, political skill was found to mediate the relationship between WSSE and several outcome variables. In addition, the WSSE inventory was found to have some advantages over the Perceived Social Self-Efficacy scale (Smith & Betz, 2000), a general social self-efficacy measure.

The six-item GSE fulfills a need for a short unidimensional measure of global self-esteem conceptualized as "overall positive view of self." The construct is traditionally measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE); however, several important shortcomings of the scale have been highlighted in the recent research. To improve the operationalization of global self-esteem, the shortcomings of the RSE and of the other measures intended to measure the construct are addressed in the construction of the GSE. Initial psychometric characteristics of the GSE, obtained in a pilot study, are reported. The results of exploratory factor analysis indicated unidimensionality of the measure-a single factor accounted for 78% of the variance in the GSE items, and the magnitude of factor loadings ranged from .81 to .91. Internal consistency reliability was high (ordinal alpha = .95), and expected relations between the GSE scores and other self-esteem measures were found. The utility of the measure and goals for future research are discussed in the context of limitations of the current study.},

  abstract={Career success is a main focus of career scholars as well as organizational stakeholders. Historically, career success has been conceptualized and measured in an objective manner, mainly as salary, rank, or number of promotions. However, the changing nature of work has also necessitated a change in the way many employees view success, adding a more subjective component. Although there has been theoretical discussion and calls to develop a comprehensive measure of subjective career success, no contemporary comprehensive quantitative measure exists. The goal of this study was to create and validate a measure of subjective career success, titled the Subjective Career Success Inventory (SCSI). The SCSI includes 24 items that address subjective career success via eight dimensions. The scale was developed and validated through four phases of data collection, beginning with interviews and focus groups, followed by item sorting tasks, then item refinement through confirmatory factor analysis, and finally convergent and discriminant validity quantitative analysis.

This study aims to extend the existing research in luxury branding domain through validating a scale to measure consumer's luxury brand aspiration.        Design/methodology/approach - Initially, the dimensions of consumer's luxury brand aspiration were identified through prior literature review and qualitative investigations. This was followed by a series of scale development studies suggested by Churchill ( 1979).        Findings - The results supported that the second-order measure of consumer's luxury brand aspiration consist of four related first-order dimensions, namely, identity signaling, social recognition, self-esteem and achievement signaling. Luxury brand aspiration was found to have direct positive influences on brand commitment and brand attachment. Brand commitment and attachment in turn significantly influence intention to pay price premium.        Originality/value - Value of this research article lies in validating a scale to measure individual's luxury brand aspiration for the first time in branding literature.},

Specifically, this research focuses on behavior following initial self-control failure, identifying a set of key cognitive and emotional responses to initial failure that jointly underlie post-failure behavior. The tendency to experience these responses is captured in a new scale, the Response-to-Failure scale, which the authors develop and test in three consumer domains: eating, spending, and cheating. The results support the use of the same emotional and cognitive factors to predict post-failure behavior across these three domains, providing evidence of the generalizability of the scale structure. The data support the scale's structure, nomological and discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability across five studies. In five additional studies, the scale's predictive validity is demonstrated beyond other existing relevant scales. The authors also develop and test a short form of each domain scale. Finally, the authors discuss the implications for understanding post-failure behavior and suggest practical uses for the scale.},

  abstract={Research on affect regulation has blossomed in recent years. However, the lack of validated scales assessing individual differences in the use of strategies to achieve alternative types of affect regulation, e.g., the regulation of others' affect and the worsening of affect, has hampered research on these important processes. This paper presents the development and validation of a brief new measure of individual differences in the use of strategies to regulate one's own and other people's feelings: the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) scale. Two distinct samples (N = 551 and N = 227) confirmed a four-factor structure: intrinsic affect-improving, intrinsic affect-worsening, extrinsic affect-improving and extrinsic affect-worsening. In line with predictions, these factors were associated with existing measures of affect regulation, personality and affect. Both intrinsic factors were positively associated with emotional exhaustion, while all factors except extrinsic affect-improving were positively associated with health-related impairments. Convergence between self- and other-reported scores on the extrinsic factors in a third sample (N = 50 dyads) demonstrated further evidence of validity.},

  abstract={Women are less competitive than men in most contexts studied. This difference has been linked to the gender gap in socio-economic outcomes. To examine whether this gender difference is linked to differential beliefs about competition, we developed a scale measuring lay beliefs about competition and tested whether these beliefs account for gender differences in competitive attitudes and behaviors. A mini meta-analysis (N = 2331) of responses to this scale shows that men attribute more positive outcomes to competition than women. In particular, men are more likely to believe that competition improves performance, builds character, and leads to creative problem-solving. In contrast, the gender differences are smaller, less robust, and inconsistent for the different negative outcomes attributed to competition, such as encouraging unethical behavior, hurting self-esteem, and damaging relationships. We also show in two studies that only positive lay beliefs about competition predict competitive attitudes and behaviors, and account for (some of) the gender difference in competitiveness. We discuss possible reasons that women and men hold different beliefs about competition and the implications of these differences for the optimal design of social and organizational structures.},

  abstract={We developed and validated a scale to measure job crafting behavior in three separate studies conducted in The Netherlands (total N = 1181). Job crafting is defined as the self-initiated changes that employees make in their own job demands and job resources to attain and/or optimize their personal (work) goals. In Study land 2 the Dutch job crafting scale (JCS) was developed and tested for its factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity. The criterion validity of the JCS was examined in Study 3. The results indicated that there are four independent job crafting dimensions, namely increasing social job resources, increasing structural job resources, increasing challenging job demands, and decreasing hindering job demands. These dimensions could be reliably measured with 21 items. The JCS shows convergent validity when correlated with the active constructs proactive personality (+), personal initiative (+), and the inactive construct cynicism (-). In addition, results indicated that self-reports of job crafting correlated positively with colleague-ratings of work engagement, employability, and performance - thus supporting the criterion validity of the JCS. Finally, self-rated job crafting behaviors correlated positively with peer-rated job crafting behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Individuals often influence others' relationships, for better or worse. We conceptualize social influence processes that impact others' social networks as brokering, and advance a multifaceted model that explains how brokering behaviors can create, terminate, reinforce, and modify others' network ties. To empirically study brokering. we introduce and validate the Brokering Orientations Scale (BOS), a multidimensional measure that captures individuals' behavioral tendencies to act as intermediaries, conciliators, and dividers. Six studies (N = 1.723) explored the psychometric properties of the BOS (Studies 1a-c) and investigated the effects of distinct forms of brokering on brokers' social capital (Studies 2-4). The intermediary, conciliatory and divisive brokering orientations related differently to extraversion, agreeableness, perspective-taking, moral identity, and Machiavellianism, among other individual differences. The effects of brokering on social capital varied as a function of the brokering orientation and the aspect of social capital. Intermediary behavior garnered status; conciliatory behavior promoted trust and prestige; and divisive behavior fueled brokers' perceived dominance. Overall, the current article elucidates the concept of brokering orientations, introduces a novel measure of brokering orientations, and explains how brokering behavior shapes brokers' social capital.},

  abstract={Persistence is often viewed as a behavioral event, whereby a person works through obstacles in the pursuit of a goal. This operationalization does not speak to persistence as an individual difference, but many researchers have observed people for which persistence appears habitual and is applied in the pursuit of all goals broadly. We suggest that several closely related constructs, such as grit and perseverance, may partially capture multiple dimensions of the overall construct of persistence. These dimensions are Persistence Despite Difficulties (PDD), Persistence Despite Fear (PDF), and Inappropriate Persistence (IP). In an initial study, we show that these three dimensions emerge in multiple measures for these closely related constructs, along with the construct of Goal Time Preference (GTP). Then, we create the Multidimensional Persistence Scale through a three-study process, showing that the scale has satisfactory psychometric properties and validity, and we support our three-dimensional conceptualization of persistence. Lastly, in two studies, we demonstrate that the three dimensions of persistence have notable and distinct relationships with personal well-being; however, only PDD appears to significantly influence organizational outcomes, supported through its significant relationship with organizational citizenship behaviors.},

  abstract={Purpose        There is a compelling need for developing constructs in management science for higher relevance rather than adapting constructs developed in other domains and applying them in organizations. An inquiry in the relevance of the construct of strength developed in personality psychology and applied to organizations is compelling, as deploying strengths leads to humanizing organizations. With growing disengagement of employees at work, this study makes a significant contribution by conceptualizing strengths in the context of organizations and carrying out two studies on independent samples for developing a psychometrically validated 14-item scale for measuring it.        Design/methodology/approach        The study has two phases. The first phase is conceptual in nature where the authors deploy the social systems theory and use recent empirical research evidence in conceptualizing the construct of employee strengths at work (ESAW). In the second phase, the author carry out two studies on independent samples for ascertaining the factor structure by carrying out EFA and then confirming it by doing a confirmatory factor analysis.        Findings        The construct of ESAW, relevant for management science, has five factors: potential deployment, person-jot fit, managerial sensitivity, prompt assimilation and joy. The psychometrically validated scale for measuring ESAW developed in this study has 14 items. Because the construct incorporates key contextual factors, it is more relevant to organizational science and contributes to humanizing organizations.        Originality/value        This study evolves the construct of ESAW from a predominantly trait-based approach to a conceptualization that accounts for the contextual factors, essential for enabling strengths of employees to manifest. The study contributes to advancing literature that holds promise for humanizing organizations - a pressing need because of the growing instances of employee disengagement. The author develop a 14-item psychometrically validated scale for measuring ESAW that the practitioners can use in first assessing current levels of employee strengths' deployment and thereafter intervening for increasing the deployment of their strengths for enabling higher well-being and superior performance.},

  abstract={Building on the work by Barrett-Lennard (Carl Rogers' helping system: Journey & substance. Sage, London 1998) and Wood et al. (J Couns Psychol 55:385-399 2008), this study describes the development and validation of a theory-based measure of state authenticity at work, the Individual Authenticity Measure at Work (IAM Work). Even though this construct is obviously relevant to the work context (e.g., as regards issues of work relations, leadership and well-being), none of the instruments currently available focuses on authenticity in the area of work and organizational psychology. A total sample of 646 participants was divided in two equal sized subsamples. Exploratory factor analysis supported the underlying tripartite construct of authenticity at work, resulting in the subscales authentic living, self-alienation, and accepting external influences. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the tripartite construct and showed good psychometric properties of the state-focused measure of authenticity at work. Finally, correlation analysis showed that each subscale and the total score of authenticity was positively related to commonly used work outcomes such as job satisfaction, in-role performance, and work engagement. This study concludes that the IAM Work is a reliable and valid measure of state authenticity at work. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract={Theory and empirical research suggest that perceived self-efficacy, or one's perceived ability to perform personally significant tasks, is related to individuals' psychological well-being and mental health. Thus, the authors hypothesized that bicultural individuals' perceived ability to function competently in 2 cultures, or perceived bicultural self-efficacy, would be related positively to their psychological wellbeing and mental health. Three studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure of perceived bicultural self-efficacy and to explore its relationships with indices of psychological well-being and mental health. Exploratory (n = 268) and confirmatory (n = 164) factor analyses on the theoretically derived Bicultural Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES) items support a measurement model that taps into the 6 dimensions of bicultural competence proposed by T. LaFromboise, H. L. K. Coleman, and J. Gerton (1993). Furthermore, initial evidence for internal consistency (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and test-retest reliability (n = 51 Asian Americans) for each of the 6 subscales were found. Finally, perceived bicultural self-efficacy was found to be related to bicultural college students' psychological well-being and mental health. Research implications of the perceived bicultural self-efficacy construct and the potential utility of the BSES as a multidimensional measure of the construct are discussed.},

  abstract={Polychronicity has traditionally been defined as a form of behavior wherein a person engages in two or more activities during the same block of time, while monochronicity occurs when a person engages in one activity at a time. These concepts have become increasingly relevant in discussions of 'time personality', worktime in the home, and technological impacts on time. Other underlying dimensions of polychronicity also exist, such as preferences and feelings towards whether to combine activities or not. In order to reflect this more complex perspective, a validated, updated measure of a person's polychronic-monochronic overall tendency is needed. The present study is a re-inquiry and extension of the Polychronic Attitude Index (PAI), introduced in 1991. In the current research plan we propose, develop, and validate a general five-item comprehensive 'reflective' single factor extended model. The general Polychronic-Monochronic Tendency Model is constructed using confirmatory factor analysis. The five-item summated scale from this model is named the Polychronic-Monochronic Tendency Scale (PMTS). A series of five separate studies were used to variously test for social desirability response bias, internal consistency, discriminant validity, and nornological validity. The PAI is also compared statistically to PMTS with the latter being clearly stronger. A discussion of the results and research implications are presented.},

  abstract={Self-esteem stability describes fluctuations in the level of self-esteem experienced by individuals over a brief period of time. In recent decades, self-esteem stability has repeatedly been shown to be an important variable affecting psychological functioning. However, measures of self-esteem stability are few and lacking in validity. In this paper, we present the Self-Esteem Stability Scale (SESS), a unidimensional and very brief scale to directly assess self-esteem stability. In four studies (total N = 826), we describe the development of the SESS and present evidence for its validity with respect to individual outcomes (life satisfaction, neuroticism, and vulnerable narcissism) and dyadic outcomes (relationship satisfaction in self- and partner ratings) through direct comparisons with existing measures. The new SESS proved to be a stronger predictor than the existing scales and had incremental validity over and above self-esteem level. The results also showed that all cross-sectional measures of self-esteem stability were only moderately associated with variability in self-esteem levels assessed longitudinally with multiple administrations of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. We discuss this validity issue, arguing that direct and indirect assessment approaches measure relevant, yet different aspects of self-esteem stability.},

  abstract={The expansion in our understanding of the structure of differential cognitive abilities afforded by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model has brought with it the need to provide practitioners with efficient and effective methods for screening which abilities most critically require assessment. A Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Abilities could assist practitioners with this process. This article outlines the development and initial validation of the Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Abilities (SRMCA), a multi-item measure designed to indicate cognitive functioning in the CHC ability areas of Fluid reasoning (GO, Comprehension-knowledge (Gc), and Visual processing (Gv). Validity was initially investigated and supported using exploratory factor analysis, and then cross-validated on a second sample using structural equation modelling (SEM). Subsequently, SEM based multitrait-multimethod analysis of the second sample confirmed convergent validity for the Gc and Gv subscales, but not the Gf subscale. The extent of method variance influence on the SRMCA was found to be non-existent, a markedly different result to that found for the single-item self-estimates of cognitive abilities. Results thus indicate that the use of multiple and specific items allows for self-ratings of distinct cognitive ability areas to be independent of one another. Suggestions for future research aimed at extending the current study are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We introduce the concept of playful work design - the proactive cognitive-behavioral orientation that employees engage in to incorporate play into their work activities to promote fun and challenge. In Study 1, we utilized expert-ratings and iterative exploratory factor analyses to develop an instrument that measures (1) designing fun and (2) designing competition. Additionally, Study 1 evidences the divergent and convergent validity of the subscales as well as their distinctiveness. Specifically, playful work design was indicative of proactivity as well as play, and designing fun especially correlated with ludic traits (i.e. traits focused on deriving fun; e.g. humor), whereas designing competition particularly correlated with agonistic traits (i.e. traits focused on deriving challenge; e.g. competitiveness). Study 2 cross-validated the two-factor structure, further investigated the nomological net of playful work design, and revealed that playful work design is distinct from job crafting. Finally, Study 3 examined the predictive and incremental validity of the playful work design instrument with self- and colleague-ratings two weeks apart. Taken together, the results suggest that the instrument may advance our understanding of play initiated by employees during work.},

  abstract={The process of development and testing of the Lang and Goulet Hardiness Scale (LGHS), a self-report instrument designed to measure hardiness in bereaved parents following the death of their fetus/infant, is presented. Hardiness is a personal resource, composed of 3 interdependent components that are characterized by a sense of personal control over the outcome of life events and hardships such as the death of a fetus/infant, an active orientation toward meeting the challenges brought on by the loss, and a belief in the ability to make sense of one's own existence following such a tragedy. The concept of hardiness has been studied by various disciplines and in a multitude of settings to understand its ability to lessen potentially negative effects of life stress. However, it has never been studied within the context of parental bereavement. The LGHS was developed systematically, originating from a concept analysis. A panel of 15 experts was used to establish content validity. A pretest was conducted on 73 bereaved individuals to assess convergent and discriminant validity of the LGHS. Subsequently, a validation study on 220 bereaved parents who had experienced the death of their fetus/infant 2 months previously was conducted including a retest 6 months after the loss with 192 of the remaining participants. Analyses reveal that the LGHS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring hardiness and that it is sensitive enough to detect changes in the construct over time.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown restrictions had repercussions on health status, psychological states of mind, and emotion regulation. Attitudes towards these restrictions, beliefs, emotions and behaviours could be wise, as in the acceptance of, and adaptation to, these constraints. On the other hand, they could be unwise, as in the rejection of rules and limitations, denial of the consequences, irrational beliefs, self-accusation, rage and general intolerance. This study aims to introduce the development and validation of the 25-item Wisdom Acquired During Emergencies Scale (WADES). It is a measure to assess the wisdom and self-regulation that are needed to cope with unexpected and unpredictable emergency situations. On the basis of a preliminary study (N-1=212 Italian adults), a multiple-choice scale of 52 items was developed. In the reliability study (N-2=1777), items were scaled, analysed according to the optimal score technique and selected to provide a final and reliable version (Cronbach's alpha=0.83). The validity study (N-3=1,345, N-4=1,445, N-5= 878) provided correlations with established scales measuring, for example, traditional wisdom, emotion regulation, empathy, post-traumatic growth, collectivism, conscientiousness and satisfaction with life. The results confirmed that high scores on the WADES are associated with the ability to regulate emotions, control impulses and develop goals in emotional situations, to tolerate current difficulties, while developing new attitudes, values and behaviours, entailing changes in self-perception and relationships. It was thus confirmed that high WADES scores indicate a higher degree of acquired wisdom.},

  abstract={Meaning in life is tied to the stories people tell about their lives. We explore whether one timeless story-the Hero's Journey-might make people's lives feel more meaningful. This enduring story appears across history and cultures and provides a template for ancient myths (e.g., Beowulf) and blockbuster books and movies (e.g., Harry Potter). Eight studies reveal that the Hero's Journey predicts and can causally increase people's experience of meaning in life. We first distill the Hero's Journey into seven key elements-protagonist, shift, quest, allies, challenge, transformation, legacy-and then develop a new measure that assesses the perceived presence of the Hero's Journey narrative in people's life stories: the Hero's Journey Scale. Using this scale, we find a positive relationship between the Hero's Journey and meaning in life with both online participants (Studies 1-2) and older adults in a community sample (Study 3). We then develop a restorying intervention that leads people to see the events of their life as a Hero's Journey (Study 4). This intervention causally increases meaning in life (Study 5) by prompting people to reflect on important elements of their lives and connecting them into a coherent and compelling narrative (Study 6). This Hero's Journey restorying intervention also increases the extent to which people perceive meaning in an ambiguous grammar task (Study 7) and increases their resilience to life's challenges (Study 8). These results provide initial evidence that enduring cultural narratives like the Hero's Journey both reflect meaningful lives and can help to create them.},

  abstract={Resume fraud is pervasive and has detrimental consequences, but researchers lack a way to study it. We develop and validate a measure for empirically investigating resume misrepresentations purposely designed to mislead recruiters. In study 1, an initial set of items designed to measure three theorized resume fraud dimensions (fabrication, embellishment, omission) are rated for content validity. In study 2, job seekers complete the measure and its factor structure is evaluated. In study 3, another sample of job seekers is surveyed to verify the measure's factor structure and to provide evidence regarding construct validity. In study 4, working adults who recently conducted a job search are surveyed to determine which individuals are more likely to commit resume fraud and whether resume fraud relates to critical work behaviors. We confirm the three-factor structure of our measure and offer evidence of construct validity by showing that socially desirable responding, Machiavellianism, moral identity, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness are related to resume fraud. Additionally, we find that resume fraud predicts reduced job performance and increased workplace deviance beyond deceptive interviewing behavior. Resume fraud is rarely studied despite the negative impact it can have on job-related outcomes. Researchers can use this measure to explore further the antecedents and outcomes of resume fraud and to advise recruiters on how to minimize it. We develop a measure focusing on intentional resume misrepresentations designed to deceive recruiters. This is one of the first studies to examine the antecedents and outcomes of resume fraud.},

  abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the question of what motivates leaders to engage in effective leadership behaviours by integrating transformational leadership theory and self-determination theory. The authors propose that the type of enacted leadership behaviour is related to level of self-determined motivation.        Design/methodology/approach - This study presents validity evidence for an 18-item scale of motivation for transformational leadership based on Gagne and Degi's (2005) six levels of internalization. A total of 310 employees (mean age = 39, 64.5 per cent female, 46 per cent formal leaders) completed the scale, other measures of leadership, and job satisfaction.        Findings Results supported the theorized six-factor structure of the scale and provided evidence for incremental validity in the prediction of job satisfaction and transformational leadership above and beyond another measure of motivation to lead.        Research limitations/implications - The lack of mnotivation and the presence of autonomously controlled extrinsic motivation are predictive of effective leadership behaviour, a key finding with implications for leadership selection, The study was limited by the use of self-report data, Future studies should examine additional predictors and outcomes of the construct (e.g. subordinate attitudes or performance and leader personality), and whether it is stable over time.        Originality/value Leaders' - motivation for role effectiveness is an unexplored area of research. This study suggests that type of motivation can be important for effective leadership and provides a validated scale for use in future leadership research and selection.},

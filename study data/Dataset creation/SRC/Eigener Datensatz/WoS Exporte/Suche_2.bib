Title = {Measuring hagioptasia: A case study in theory-testing through
   Internet-based personality scale development},
Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {159},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This article is presented as a case study illustrating the interplay
   between theory-testing, personality scale development, and construct
   validation. A new construct, hagioptasia, is proposed and scale
   development and initial construct validity research are described.
   Hagioptasia is conceptualized as a tendency to perceive certain persons
   and places are preternaturally ``special{''} and as a desire to
   participate in that otherworldly specialness when, objectively, there is
   really nothing unearthly about the person or situation. Item and factor
   analyses support a general construct of hagioptasia with two subthemes:
   (1) attraction to glamourous, famous persons and a desire for similar
   achievement and recognition and (2) an aesthetic sense of wonder and
   transcendence. Items assessing these two subthemes correlated with a
   short measure of Enterprising and Artistic vocational interests,
   respectively. While the theory of hagioptasia and the validity of a
   hagioptasia scale received some support through associations with age,
   gender, educational level, and religious orientation, difficulties were
   noted with reverse-scored items and with assessing hagioptasia as an
   illusory or purely imaginary perception of specialness. Directions for
   future scale development and theory-testing are discussed.},

Title = {The Good Manager: Development and Validation of the Managerial
   Interpersonal Skills Scale},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {It is no secret that employees leave their organizations because of bad
   managers- but what about the good ones? How can researchers and
   organizations differentiate individuals in terms of the interpersonal
   skills needed to perform well in the managerial role? Although these are
   fundamentally important questions to organizational psychologists, there
   exists no conceptual model, definition, or measure of interpersonal
   skills specific to the managerial role. We address these questions and
   research gaps by developing a conceptual model and validating a
   concomitant measure of managerial interpersonal skills (MIPS) through a
   research program that included four studies across three phases: First,
   through a review of the literature and structured interviews with
   practicing managers; next, three quantitative studies in which we
   develop, refine and validate our MIPS scale; and finally, in a fourth
   validation study with matched supervisor-employee data from a large
   healthcare organization. Results suggest that MIPS are best represented
   by a three-dimensional model comprised of supporting, motivating and
   managing conflict all indicating a higher-order latent MIPS factor.
   Results also indicate the MIPS Scale predicts job attitudes and
   performance among both employees and managers above and beyond
   personality traits and leader-member exchange, as well as constructs
   closely related to MIPS, such as social support and conflict management

   Potential of State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 6},
Abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly
   popular in industrial and organizational psychology. One promising area
   for NLP-based applications is scale development; yet, while many
   possibilities exist, so far these applications have been
   restricted-mainly focusing on automated item generation. The current
   research expands this potential by illustrating an NLP-based approach to
   content analysis, which manually categorizes scale items by their
   measured constructs. In NLP, content analysis is performed as a text
   classification task whereby a model is trained to automatically assign
   scale items to the construct that they measure. Here, we present an
   approach to text classification-using state-of-the-art transformer
   models-that builds upon past approaches. We begin by introducing
   transformer models and their advantages over alternative methods. Next,
   we illustrate how to train a transformer to content analyze Big Five
   personality items. Then, we compare the models trained to human raters,
   finding that transformer models outperform human raters and several
   alternative models. Finally, we present practical considerations,
   limitations, and future research directions.},

Abstract = {A substantial literature stream indicates there are benefits to having a
   favorable brand personality, such as enhanced brand attitudes and
   purchase intentions and higher levels of consumer trust and loyalty.
   Contemporary advertisements and promotional activities by a host of
   firms demonstrate a managerial belief in the value of establishing a
   brand personality that mirrors that of branding scholars. Yet extant
   research has yet to fully evaluate the perceived appeal of brand
   personality to consumers. This issue is important to managers because it
   is precisely this level of appeal that influences target consumers'
   purchase decisions and helps to sustain the endurance of a brand's
   perceived personality between promotional cycles. This article
   conceptualizes, develops, and validates measures for assessing a
   consumer's perception of brand personality appeal (BPA). Three
   dimensions of BPA (favorability, originality, clarity) emerge and are

Abstract = {The present study is an effort to develop an e-tailer personality scale.
   Subsequently, we check the impacts of e-tailer personality on
   self-congruity and behavioral intentions such as intention to reshop and
   intention to recommend. We have followed a traditional scale development
   method - item generation, purification, and dimension assessment. A
   structure questionnaire has been used to collect primary data online. A
   structure equation model was used to analyze the data. This study has
   developed a e-tailer personality scale of five dimensions:
   sophistication, competence, excitement, sincerity, and convenience. The
   results of a structural equation model largely support the propositions
   that e-tailer personality is positively related to self-congruity. The
   results also show that e-tailer personality, behavioral intentions and
   self-congruity are positively related. A comparison of the developed
   scale with the existing brand personality scales, results in a unique
   dimension of e-tailer personality scale. Arguably, this study may be
   seen as a first study in an emerging economy and online retailing
   domain. The results have both academic and managerial implications.},

Abstract = {Despite pervasive evidence that general mental ability and personality

   examined a large sample of job applicant responses to four personality
   scales for differential functioning across groups of differing general

   differentially function across highly disparate general mental ability
   groups, there was little evidence of differential functioning across
   groups with similar levels of general mental ability. Study 2 replicated
   these findings in a different sample, using a different measure of

   psychometric properties of these personality scales are likely due to
   the information processing capabilities of the respondents.
   Additionally, we describe how differential functioning analyses can be
   used during scale development as a method of identifying items that are
   not appropriate for all intended respondents. In so doing, we

Title = {Cognitive rationalization in occupational fraud: structure exploration

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The structure and measurement of occupational fraud rationalization as
   one of the motivations for fraudulent behavior has been a major obstacle
   in theoretical research and practical problems. In order to answer the
   fundamental question, ``What does cognitive rationalization of
   occupational fraud involve?,{''} this paper explored the structure and
   scale development of the internal psychological factors of occupational
   fraud rationalization. Several research methods were used for this
   purpose, such as data collection, research interviews, review \&
   verification, project purification, structural verification, and
   reliability \& validity test. The results showed that, based on the
   internal structure, occupational fraud rationalization presented
   second-order three-dimensional and first-order eight-dimensional
   factors. Further, a formal scale containing 27 items related to the
   structure of the metric was constructed to measure the occupational
   fraud rationalization. In terms of variable correlations, this paper
   empirically tested the criterion validity of occupational fraud
   rationalization from the perspective of personality traits. The result
   revealed a significant positive (negative) correlation between
   Machiavellian traits (empathy traits) and occupational fraud
   rationalization, respectively. In conclusion, this paper provides an
   attempt to address the cognitive and measurement challenges of
   occupational fraud rationalization, expanding the application and
   development of moral disengagement theory in the field of occupational
   fraud and laying some groundwork for subsequent research and

Abstract = {Retest reliability is a better predictor of validity than is internal
   consistency. One explanation for this is item-specific variance, which
   distinguishes different nuances of a facet and contributes to retest
   reliability but not internal consistency. Specific variance at the facet
   level is temporally stable, consensually validated, and heritable; a
   consideration of the role of specific variance in personality measures
   leads to a distinction between traits as the intersection () versus the
   union () of their constituents. I discuss specific variance at the item
   level and its implications for scale development and argue that retest
   reliability outpredicts internal consistency because item-specific
   variance has been shown to be observable, and is probably heritable and
   stable. I consider some implications of these ideas for the use of
   single-item scales, the causal interpretation of traits, and the notion
   of scalar equivalence. Finally, I note that the sources of random error
   in scales are still poorly understood.},

   predictions regarding the role of individual differences in perceptions
   of situational strength, support for theoretically based moderator
   effects on organizational citizenship behavior, and the presence of

   Generation in Psychological Scale Development},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 16},
Abstract = {Measurement is at the heart of scientific research. As many-perhaps
   most-psychological constructs cannot be directly observed, there is a
   steady demand for reliable self-report scales to assess latent
   constructs. However, scale development is a tedious process that
   requires researchers to produce good items in large quantities. In this
   tutorial, we introduce, explain, and apply the Psychometric Item
   Generator (PIG), an open-source, free-to-use, self-sufficient natural
   language processing algorithm that produces large-scale, human-like,
   customized text output within a few mouse clicks. The PIG is based on
   the GPT-2, a powerful generative language model, and runs on Google
   Colaboratory-an interactive virtual notebook environment that executes
   code on state-of-the-art virtual machines at no cost. Across two
   demonstrations and a preregistered five-pronged empirical validation
   with two Canadian samples (N-Sample 1 = 501, N-Sample 2 = 773), we show
   that the PIG is equally well-suited to generate large pools of
   face-valid items for novel constructs (i.e., wanderlust) and create
   parsimonious short scales of existing constructs (i.e., Big Five
   personality traits) that yield strong performances when tested in the
   wild and benchmarked against current gold standards for assessment. The
   PIG does not require any prior coding skills or access to computational
   resources and can easily be tailored to any desired context by simply
   switching out short linguistic prompts in a single line of code. In
   short, we present an effective, novel machine learning solution to an
   old psychological challenge. As such, the PIG will not require you to
   learn a new language-but instead, speak yours.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {598-613},
Abstract = {Purpose - There is increasing interest in understanding negative
   consumer reactions to brands and the nature of negative brand
   perceptions. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize the construct
   of brand hypocrisy from a consumer perspective and develop a scale to
   measure it.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multiphase scale development process
   involving 559 consumers was conducted. Study 1 pertains to item
   generation and reduction phases. Study 2 reports on scale purification
   and validation through confirmatory factor analyses and model
   comparisons. Study 3 focuses on discriminant and predictive validity,
   while Study 4 further investigates predictive validity using real brands
   with differences in brand hypocrisy.
   Findings - A 12-item scale measuring four dimensions of brand hypocrisy
   is developed: image hypocrisy (brand failing to put words into action),
   mission hypocrisy (brand exerting an unacknowledged negative impact on
   society or consumer well-being), message hypocrisy (brand conveying
   unrealistic or unattainable images) and social hypocrisy (brand
   supporting social responsibility initiatives for strategic purposes
   only). Results indicate that brand hypocrisy is distinguishable from
   similar constructs in the literature and that it is a significant
   predictor of negative word-of-mouth and brand distance. Practical
   implications - This conceptualization provides managers with a detailed
   understanding of what constitutes a hypocritical brand in the eyes of
   consumers as well as insights about how to prevent consumer perceptions
   of brand hypocrisy.
   Originality/value - Findings enrich the understanding of negative
   consumer inferences related to brands and provide a conceptualization of
   an understudied but increasingly relevant form of brand judgment.},

   Orientation Scale.{''} Journal of Business Research 112: 190-9 proposed
   a five-dimensional conceptualization of individual entrepreneurial
   orientation (IEO), but more evidence is needed before authors can
   reliably apply their conceptualization and operationalization. We
   provide a theoretical critique of their conceptualization and continue
   their scale development process. Four of five dimensions converged with
   other scales of the same constructs, but their passion dimension did
   not. The factor structure and predictive validity evidence also
   suggested that passion should not be included within the scope of IEO,
   and we assert that Santos et al.'s conceptualization of IEO is better
   represented with a hierarchical structure. Proactiveness and
   perseverance as well as risk-taking and innovativeness load onto two
   separate second-order factors, and these two second-order factors load
   onto the broader factor of IEO. We suggest that the construct measured
   by Santos et al.'s passion dimension may instead be a mediator between
   IEO and entrepreneurial outcomes, and we provide further insights into
   the measurement of IEO.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Chinese people are known to be strong in dialectical thinking - a
   cognitive tendency toward the acceptance of contradiction. Based on this
   finding, we conceptualized cooperative and competitive orientation as
   two distinct constructs that represent individual beliefs about and
   attitudes toward the nature of their relationship with others. We
   hypothesized that as stable individual differences, cooperative and
   competitive orientation would have differential effects on people's
   cognition and behaviour. Adopting a contextualization approach to
   Chinese management research, we developed a seven-item cooperative
   orientation scale and a six-item competitive orientation scale that
   demonstrated high reliabilities and validities. A laboratory experiment
   using the response latency method showed that people scoring higher on
   cooperative orientation responded significantly faster toward words of a
   cooperative nature, whereas people scoring higher on competitive
   orientation responded significantly faster toward words of a competitive
   nature. A field survey in multiple Chinese organizations further showed
   that cooperative and competitive orientation had differential effects on
   employee task performance and organizational citizenship behaviour
   beyond the effects of the personality differences. The theoretical and
   practical implications of this study are discussed in the context of
   work groups in Chinese organizations and beyond.},

Abstract = {This study expands on past deceleration and slow consumption research by
   introducing and validating a measure of need-for-deceleration, an

   development, two studies establish construct validity by placing
   need-for-deceleration into a nomological network. Results indicate that
   the measure correlated with, but was distinct from, variables involving
   negative affective states, such as state anxiety and neuroticism.
   Need-for-deceleration scores were not related to materialism, but
   negatively correlated with self-efficacy, life satisfaction, work-life
   balance, and conscientiousness. Correlations were positive with
   need-for-uniqueness, future time orientation, and susceptibility to
   normative influence. Need-for-deceleration was also associated with
   regulatory focus (positively with prevention, and negatively with
   promotion focus). To explore criterion validity, a third study
   establishes associations between need-for-deceleration and consumer
   lifestyle variables. Developing and validating the scale can help
   researching and managing products relating to the consumption of time,

Abstract = {Social attachment can explain well the bond between users and social

   To this end, this study takes attachment theory as the basis for scale

   studies on social attachment, selects three representative social media

   consists of three constructs: social connection, social dependence and
   social identity, and the scale possesses high reliability and validity.
   This study has developed and validated a social attachment scale in the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Human beings seek out social interactions as a source of reward. To
   date, there have been limited attempts to identify different forms of
   social reward, and little is known about how the value of social rewards
   might vary between individuals. This study aimed to address both these
   issues by developing the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ), a measure of
   individual differences in the value of different social rewards.
   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was run on an initial set of 75 items
   (N = 305). Based on this analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
   was then conducted on a second sample (N = 505) with a refined 23-item
   scale. This analysis was used to test a six-factor structure, which
   resulted in good model fit (CFI = 0.96, RSMEA = 0.07). The factors
   represent six subscales of social reward defined as follows: Admiration;
   Negative Social Potency; Passivity; Prosocial Interactions; Sexual
   Reward; and Sociability. All subscales demonstrated good test-retest
   reliability and internal consistency. Each subscale also showed a
   distinct pattern of associations with external correlates measuring
   personality traits, attitudes, and goals, thus demonstrating construct
   validity. Taken together, the findings suggest that the SRQ is a
   reliable, valid measure that can be used to assess individual

Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {662-678},

Abstract = {Brand user imagery is an important aspect of brand association and,
   consequently, brand equity. Extant conceptualizations emphasize content
   features of brand user imagery (e.g., convergence and favorability) but
   neglect the structural element of the concept, namely the clarity of the
   imagery. The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of brand
   user imagery clarity (BUIC) as a distinct and salient aspect of brand
   user imagery. Drawing on the associate network theory of memory, we
   offer a conceptualization of BUIC and then proceed to empirically
   validate a BUIC scale using data from 1172 consumers across four surveys
   and multiple industries. Results demonstrate the reliability of our
   5-item BUIC scale. The scale consistently demonstrates convergent
   validity and discriminant validity (in relation to brand user imagery
   favorability, brand prestige, brand quality, and brand personality).
   Assessment of nomological validity identifies premium pricing strategy
   as a key determinant of BUIC and self-brand connection as an important
   outcome. This study contributes to branding literature by proposing BUIC
   as an important structural feature of brand user imagery and developing
   a reliable BUIC scale. It also contributes to the consumer-brand
   relationship literature by indicating the significant effect of BUIC on
   self-brand connection.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {551-565},

Abstract = {Based on three empirical studies, this research sets out to
   conceptualise and subsequently operationalise the construct of consumer
   perceived ethicality (CPE) of a company or brand. Study 1 investigates
   consumer meanings of the term ethical and reveals that, contrary to
   philosophical scholars' exclusively consequentialist or
   nonconsequentialist positions, consumers' ethical judgments are a
   function of both these evaluation principles, illustrating that not any
   one scholarly definition of ethics alone is capable of capturing the
   content domain. The resulting conceptualisation identifies six key
   themes explicating the construct. Building upon these findings, studies
   2 and 3 were conducted to operationalise CPE. Such operationalisation is
   an essential prerequisite for future explorations and theory development
   given the absence of a suitable tool to capture and quantify the
   strength and direction of CPE. The key focus was on developing a valid
   and reliable multi-item measurement tool that is practical, parsimonious
   and easy to administer. The scale's general applicability allows
   deployment in academic and business contexts as well as different
   research areas and doing thus facilitates the much-needed theory
   building in this new research area.},

Pages = {675-690},

Abstract = {This paper aims to conceptualise consumer's luxury brand attachment by
   developing and validating a psychometric scale through five studies.
   Study 1 generates and selects potential scale items through literature
   review, thesaurus search, and expert surveys. Study 2 reduces the items
   and assesses the dimensionality of the scale. Study 3 validates the
   dimensionality of the scale. Next, study 4 assesses the four types of
   validities (convergent, discriminate, predictive, and nomological) for
   the scale. Finally, study 5 examines two behavioural indicators of
   luxury brand attachment. The results show a parsimonious seven-item
   luxury brand attachment scale. The studies confirm that there are major
   differences among luxury brand attachment, emotional attachments to
   brands, and the brand attitude scales. Besides, this research
   demonstrates that the luxury brand attachment is a unique construct that
   captures the essence of consumers' emotional connection with luxury
   brands. The development and validation of luxury brand attachment scale
   fulfil an important gap in the luxury branding literature. The scale
   will provide meaningful insights for the luxury practitioners. The
   luxury brand attachment scale provides an improved measure and better
   understanding of consumer's attachment to the luxury brands which was
   not accurately measured by using general attachment scales in past
   studies.},

   development and preliminary empirical testing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article reports on the development and preliminary empirical
   testing of two new scales designed to assess workaholic behavioral
   patterns. One scale assessed employee tendencies to perform nonrequired
   work (typically, spending time thinking of ways to perform work better),
   and the other measured tendencies to intrude on and attempt to control
   the work of others. These scales seem consistent with both conceptual
   definitions and anecdotal accounts of workaholism. Moreover, the scales
   were designed to assess behavioral tendencies rather than work
   attitudes, to circumvent the possibility of rationalization and denial
   among workaholic respondents, and to be applicable across multiple work
   contexts. Evidence from a sample of 278 employed respondents indicated
   that the scales were internally consistent, and represented distinct
   constructs. The scales also demonstrated evidence of convergent and
   discriminant validity. For example, scores on the nonrequired work scale
   correlated positively with hours worked and with the needs for
   achievement, autonomy, and affiliation. Scores on the control of others
   scale correlated positively with job involvement, stress, work-nonwork
   conflict, role conflict, dominance needs, and self-monitoring, In
   summary, the workaholism scales developed for this investigation appear
   both reliable and valid and thus potentially able to shed light on the
   phenomenon of workaholism.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {156-177},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and validate an indigenous measure
   of Chinese traditional values using Chinese proverbs. A sample of 363
   Mainland Chinese undergraduates participated in Study 1, in which a
   26-item Chinese Proverb Scale (CPS) was developed through factor
   analysis on an initial pool of 118 Chinese proverbs. Four factors were
   clearly identified: (a) Diligence, (b) Integrity, (c) Self-Preservation,
   and (d) Self-Interest. The CPS showed satisfactory convergent validity
   with personal values (S. H. Schwartz, 1992, Advances In Experimental
   Social Psychology, San Diego, Academic Press) and social axioms (K.
   Leung et al., 2002, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 33, p. 286).
   For incremental validity, the CPS predicted life satisfaction beyond the
   Big Five personality, personal values, and social axioms. In Study 2, a
   sample of 239 Mainland Chinese participants completed the CPS across two
   measurement occasions with an interval of 6 months. Longitudinal
   structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed the structure of the CPS was
   robust and invariant over time. In Study 3, a sample of 167 Chinese
   undergraduates from Hong Kong responded to an adapted version of the
   CPS. Multigroup SEM showed structural equivalence of the scale across
   the mainland and Hong Kong samples. The cultural origins of the factors
   in the CPS and future applications of the scale in various research
   areas are discussed.},

Abstract = {This research details the development of the ``comfort with

   differences in interpersonal touch tendencies and preferences. The CIT
   construct is defined as the degree to which an individual is comfortable
   with intentional interpersonal touch from or to another person. The
   scale incorporates the distinction between initiating touch, which is
   the act of touching someone else, and receiving touch, which is the act
   of being touched by someone else. Investigation of this construct
   includes scale development, measure purification, and validation. We
   situate CIT-initiating and CIT-receiving within an approach avoidance
   framework and demonstrate that comfort with initiating touch is more
   related to approach tendencies such as assertiveness while comfort with
   receiving touch is more related to avoidant tendencies such as avoiding
   crowded spaces. While previous research generally finds positive effects
   of interpersonal touch, we find that these effects, at least in part,
   depend on an individual's comfort with interpersonal touch. We discuss
   theoretical and managerial implications as well as future research

Abstract = {The present study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the
   Polish version of the managing the emotions of others scale (MEOS). MEOS
   consists of six dimensions: mood enhancing (Enhance), mood worsening
   (Worsen), concealing emotions from others (Conceal), use of inauthentic
   displays for self-serving purposes (Inauthentic), poor emotion skills
   (Poor skills), and use of diversion to enhance another's mood (Divert).
   The results showed that among MEOS dimensions, Enhance was the most
   strongly related to performance-based emotional intelligence. Among the
   Dark Triad, Narcissism was related to the greatest number of MEOS
   subscalesall except Poor skills. The results indicated that the MEOS has
   a similar factor structure, reliability, and pattern of correlations
   with personality and emotional intelligence in Poland as in previous
   studies.},

Abstract = {This study presents a new method for developing faking detection scales
   based on idiosyncratic item-response patterns. Two scoring schemes based
   on this approach strongly differentiated between scores obtained under
   honest vs directed faking conditions in cross-validation samples
   (r(pb)=.45 and .67). This approach is shown to successfully classify
   between 20\% and 37\% of faked personality measures with only a 1\%
   false positive rate in a sample comprised of 56\% honest responses. Of
   equal importance, this method does not result in a scale that
   meaningfully correlates with personality or cognitive ability tests.
   This study raises many questions about both the source and
   generalizabiltiy of the effect. Key directions for future research and
   improved scale development that may limit or enhance the utility of the
   idiosyncratic item-response method are discussed.},

Abstract = {An analysis of social desirability in personality assessment is

   useful heuristic tool for identifying items which elicit socially
   desirable responding. We diagnose the cause of socially desirable
   responding as an interaction between the evaluative content of the item
   and enhancement motivation in the rater. Study 2 introduced a possible
   cure; evaluative neutralization of items. To test the feasibility of the
   method lay psychometricians (undergraduates) reformulated existing
   personality test items according to written instructions. The new items
   were indeed lower in social desirability while essentially retaining the
   five factor structure and reliability of the inventory. We conclude that

Title = {Development and Validation of a Scale to Measure Glass Ceiling Among
   Women Employees in the Banking Sector},
Journal = {GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 OCT 31},
Abstract = {It is generally believed that when compared to men, women have slower
   career advancement prospects. Usually, women in the workforce face
   several obstacles, commonly referred to as glass ceiling (GC), that
   weaken their career advancement prospects. The present study aims to
   develop a scale to measure the GC obstacles faced by women employed in
   the banking sector. The scale was developed and validated through a
   three-step process: item development, scale development and scale
   evaluation. The items were generated through literature review and focus
   group discussions (FGDs). The items developed were fine-tuned in
   consultation with academic experts. The scale was developed and
   validated, through a study, covering 411 women employees working in
   different banks in the state of Kerala. Exploratory factor analysis
   (EFA) brought out seven dimensions of GC, namely family responsibilities
   (FR), discriminatory promotion practices (DPP), employee relations (ER),
   personality traits (PT), lack of organizational support (LOS), gender
   stereotypes (GS) and lack of training (LT). The scale was evaluated
   using reliability and validity measures, and it demonstrated adequate
   reliability, discriminant and convergent validity. The confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) was carried out using AMOS. Towards the end of the
   article, there is also a discussion on managerial implications,
   limitations of the study and directions for future research.},

Abstract = {The brand personality of nonprofit service organizations (NPO) is a

   authors examine how monetary incentives and brand personality commonly
   affect the intention to donate and whether this effect varies based on
   the perceived trustworthiness of the NPO. The results of two
   experimental studies show that branding and incentivizing decisions
   should not be developed independently because monetary incentives do
   indeed undermine the positive effects of brand personality on the
   intention to donate. However, the effectiveness of incentives varies
   with the perceived level of trust in the NPO: highly trusted NPO
   services are harmed by monetary incentives, whereas less-trusted NPOs
   may even benefit.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1275-1298},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Strikes are a recurrent phenomenon in many countries. However, research
   on strikes from a psychological perspective has been limited. By
   developing a sound measure to assess attitudes and behavioral reactions
   to strikes, we will be in a better position to evaluate these constructs
   in individuals and compare across studies. Therefore, we developed a
   scale to assess attitudes and behavioral reactions to strikes following
   classic scale development guidelines using four samples (total N = 1369;
   N-1 = 304, N-2 = 209, N-3 = 443, N-4 = 413). In Study 1, we used
   exploratory factor analysis to reduce the generated items to a scale and
   showed that the strike attitude and behavioral reactions scale consists
   of one affective factor (negative reactions towards strikes), one
   cognitive factor (legitimacy of strikes), and three behavioral factors
   (informing oneself about strikes, strike-related social network
   behavior, and support of strikers). Study 2 confirmed these five factors
   and showed acceptable psychometric properties. Study 3 supported the
   construct validity of the developed scale: the five factors were
   correlated with willingness to strike and attitudes towards unions,
   among other variables. Study 4 further showed that the scale can also
   capture attitudes and behavioral reactions towards specific strikes.
   Overall, these studies indicate that the strike attitude and behavioral
   reactions scale is a psychometrically sound measure consisting of five
   factors.},

Abstract = {There is a general lack of clarity regarding measurement of the

   study tests and validates a personality congruence scale in the luxury
   sector on an international level. Based on a survey of nearly 1500
   international luxury customers, it also measures the effect of
   congruence on brand attachment. The findings confirm that the
   personality congruence structure is based on five dimensions: prestige,
   emotion, trust, anxiety, and order. The results highlight the
   personality congruence effect and its influence on brand attachment.
   Finally, similarities and differences across countries are detected in
   the personality con-gruence and brand attachment relationship.
   Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed. This study
   contributes to the literature on brand personality congruence and its
   impact on brand attachment in the luxury context.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop a destination personality scale utilizing a

Abstract = {The success of a brand relies on the extent to which it differentiates

   distinctive, brand personality is viewed as a viable metaphor for
   understanding consumers' perceptions of brands and for crafting a unique
   identity in their minds. Measurement and management of brand personality
   becomes significant in this regard. Most of the existing brand
   personality scales are either designed to measure the brand personality
   construct in general or to measure particular categories of brands.
   There is a lack of a scale which measures the personality of product
   brands as such. This research tries to fill this lacuna by creating a
   new product brand personality scale incorporating various advancements
   in the field of brand personality measurement. This study employs a
   mixed method approach and the important phases include construct
   definition, item generation, measure purification, assessment of
   reliability and validity, and development of a short version of the
   scale. Findings of this research reconfirm the consumers' tendency to
   attribute personality characteristics to brands. It also identifies

Title = {Brand love measurement scale development: an inter-cultural analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {471-489},
Abstract = {Purpose The main purpose of this paper is to develop a brand love
   measurement scale, adopting an etic approach and testing for differences
   on how consumers experience brand love across different cultures.
   Design/methodology/approach An integrative model of brand love was first
   developed and then data was collected through an online survey (N = 322)
   in two countries (the USA and Portugal) with different characteristics
   (individualistic vs collectivistic). A structural equation model method
   was followed, including an exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory
   factor analysis and multi-group analysis to test the set of hypotheses.
   Findings As proposed in the initial model, results indicate that brand
   love is the result of a dynamic interaction between five integrated
   emotional dimensions: passionate driven behavior, commitment, affection
   and connection, consumer-brand identification and brand relationship.
   The multi-group analysis across countries suggests that the
   socio-cultural context, namely, the collectivistic vs individualistic
   nature of the sample, significantly influences the brand love
   experience.
   Originality/value This is the first brand love measurement scale
   developed from an etic perspective, encompassing complex and dynamic
   emotional dimensions that in combination, form the brand love
   experience. Results indicate that the brand love experience may
   significantly differ from culture to culture, pointing out the most
   relevant dimensions in each of the socio-cultural contexts that better
   predict brand love and its consequences. These findings are particularly
   relevant for practitioners working on global brand management.},

Abstract = {Despite an emerging body of research on a personality trait termed core
   self-evaluations, the trait continues to be measured indirectly. The
   present study reported the results of a series of studies that developed
   and tested the validity of the Core Self-Evaluations Scale (CSES), a
   direct and relatively brief measure of the trait. Results indicated that
   the 12-item CSES was reliable, displayed a unitary factor structure,
   correlated significantly with job satisfaction, job performance, and
   life satisfaction, and had validity equal to that of an optimal
   weighting of the 4 specific core traits (self-esteem, generalized
   self-efficacy, neuroticism, and locus of control), and incremental
   validity over the 5-factor model. Overall, results suggest that the CSES
   is a valid measure that should prove useful in applied psychology
   research.},

Abstract = {An evolutionary psychology framework was used to develop a five-factor
   model of individual differences in the domain of social exchange that
   built on a prior two-factor model (Leybman, Zuroff, Fournier, Kelly, \&

   Social Exchange Styles Questionnaire (SESQ-II), the reliability and
   validity of its five scales, and the relationship between social
   exchange styles (SESs) and social support. Principal components and
   principal factor analyses of the SESQ-II in 226 undergraduates found
   five social exchange dimensions: Tracking, Fairness, Individualism,
   Benefit-Seeking, and Overinvestment. These scales showed good internal
   consistency and retest reliability. Multiple regression analyses
   demonstrated that SESs, while distinct from other personality variables,
   had expected relationships with several variables and predicted social
   support patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   construct of active procrastination has a high potential to expand the
   time management literature and is likely to be adopted by researchers in
   multiple areas of psychology. To facilitate the research on this new
   construct and its further integration into the literature, the authors
   developed and validated a new, expanded measure of active
   procrastination that reliably assesses its four dimensions. Using this
   new measure of active procrastination, they further examined its
   nomological network. The new 16-item measure is a critical step toward
   further empirical investigation of active procrastination.},

Abstract = {In this research, we conceptualized brand anthropomorphism as a property

   scale of brand anthropomorphism that captures the multidimensional
   nature of the construct. The proposed scale is composed of three
   dimensions, two of which assess the extent to which the external
   appearance of a branded product resembles the lineaments of a human body
   and the physiognomy of a human face, and a third dimension, which
   assesses the extent to which such a product reflects how consumers
   perceive themselves. Results across two empirical studies showed that
   the scale is robust, as it passed several validity tests, and
   demonstrated its predictive power over brand personality and brand
   loyalty. Our scale is the first proposed in brand anthropomorphism
   research to receive empirical validation, thus offering theoretical and

Abstract = {Corporate reputation (CR) can support a business from different

   relationship between CR and customer citizenship behaviour (CCB) has
   received little consideration in research so far. The aim of this paper
   is therefore dual: to study the direct effect of CR on three different
   dimensions of CCB; and to examine the moderating effects of personality
   differences (extroversion and neuroticism) and gender in relation to the
   respective relationships. This investigation employs structural equation
   modelling using a sample of 278 consumers of retail fashion in Italy.
   The results show that CR positively affects the three considered
   dimensions of CCB. Even though no significant moderating effect of the
   considered personality traits was found, the connection between CR and
   helping others appears to be significantly moderated by gender,
   suggesting that females are more willing to help others than males.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Both individuals and organizations benefit when workers can effectively
   cope with stressors in the work and family domains. This study takes an
   inductive approach to the development of a work stressor coping scale
   and a family stressor coping scale.
   In phase one, a comprehensive list of coping strategies was generated
   through a multi-step content analysis of qualitative interviews. In
   phase two, the content validity of the work stressor and family stressor
   coping strategy scales was established using data from three samples;
   and in phase three, convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related
   validity evidence were obtained using data from two samples.
   A multi-step content analysis of qualitative interview data was used to
   develop a list of 365 coping strategy statements (182 work and 183
   family) representing 11 work and 14 family stressor coping strategies.
   Multiple samples were used to reduce the number of scale items, and
   establish evidence for the scales' content, construct, and
   criterion-related validity. The final work stressor coping scale
   consisted of 36 items assessing 12 different strategies, and the final
   family stressor coping scale consisted of 45 items assessing 15
   different strategies.
   Findings from the present study suggest that individuals may use a wider
   variety of strategies to cope with work stressors and family stressors
   than previously thought, and these strategies may be differentially
   effective depending on the stressor domain (i.e., work or family) and
   outcome (e.g., work-to-family conflict vs. family-to-work conflict).
   The inductive nature of our study resulted in a comprehensive and
   domain-specific scales assessing how individuals cope with work
   stressors and family stressors.},

   and principledness, and was distinct from other self-esteem facets not
   based on honourable character traits. Importantly, it related to
   well-being and prosocial behaviour over-and-above self-esteem. The

   male. In this study, we used the Semantic Misattribution Procedure to
   assess men's implicit masculine self-concept. As expected, implicit
   masculine self-concept was not associated with social desirability, but
   was positively associated with several gender-relevant outcomes,
   including conformity to masculine norms, endorsement of traditional
   masculinity ideology, hostile sexism, and benevolent sexism. We also
   found support for a mediation model in which explicit masculine
   self-concept mediated the impact of implicit masculine self-concept on
   these outcomes. These results provide evidence for the importance of
   implicit masculine self-concept when exploring gender-relevant outcomes.

Pages = {451-458},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Rational-Experiential Multimodal Inventory (REIm) is a recent tool
   showing promise in the measurement of self-reported thinking style -
   preference for rational or experiential processing - and offers
   three-faceted measurement of the latter. We present the first short form
   of the measure, the REIm-13, and test its factor structure, reliability,
   and validity in a large community sample. Participants were N = 920
   Australian adults (502 females) who completed an online survey (N = 510
   of whom participated in a follow-up survey). In addition to the REIm,
   participants completed a Big Five personality measure. The internal
   consistency of the REIm-13 was acceptable given the limited number of
   items (.52-.68). Furthermore, test-retest reliability was high (rho =
   .64-.74) for the theorized four-factor and two-factor solutions.
   Construct validity was established by examining the relationship between
   short-form and full REIm factors (rho = .65-.71), and the validity of
   composite scoring was confirmed against factor scoring. Relationship
   with age (a slight negative relationship to both main scales), gender
   (females reporting higher Experientiality, males higher Rationality),
   and Big Five variables largely followed previous findings, demonstrating
   concurrent validity. The study demonstrates that the REIm-13 provides
   sound measurement of thinking style.},

Abstract = {The Global Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJWS) has been widely used in
   measuring the Belief in a Just World (BJW) personality trait. Despite
   its widespread application across the social sciences, the validity of
   this scale has not been sufficiently tested in the literature. In this
   research, the authors examine the internal and external validity of the
   GBJWS using both standard correlational analyses and structural equation
   modeling (SEM). Specifically, the authors test the concurrent validity,
   internal consistency, uni-dimensional structure, convergent validity,
   and both measurement and latent mean invariance of the scale across
   gender and culture. The results of a pilot study suggest strong
   concurrent validity of the GBJWS with other BJW scales, and the findings
   of the two main studies support the internal and external validity of
   GBJWS across gender and culture. The authors' results further show an
   overall greater level of BJW of Chinese individuals compared to
   Americans. The present research provides a much needed investigation of
   the validity of the GBJWS, and answers calls for research examining the
   scale's utility across different populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {293-312},
Abstract = {Four product inventors and 2 control participants were interviewed
   intensively about their creative process and given a series of
   personality assessments. The inventors expressed a profound level of
   emotional experience as part of their creative process. Though many
   emotions were mentioned, the inventors spoke repeatedly and consistently
   about their enjoyment of innovation work. Personality assessments
   indicated, however, that personality alone could not explain this high
   level of career happiness. The inventor discussions of their emotional
   experience were analyzed using the Russ (1993, 1999) model of affect and
   creativity. Every dimension of the Russ model was found evident in the
   inventors' innovation experiences. The inventor discussions encouraged
   an elaboration and expansion of the model. One category, cognitive
   integration and modulation of affect, was expanded to include the role
   of intuition. Four new categories were added: affective pleasure in
   technical perspective-taking, in focus, in creating, and in
   self-expression. The resulting expanded model of affect and creativity
   offers myriad opportunities for future researchers interested in scale
   development and in qualitative inquiry with other creative professions.
   Educators, counselors, and managers seeking to understand how to best
   foster innovation and career happiness may also benefit.},

   each other. Examination of convergent and discriminant validity
   indicated that the two scales measured distinct and specific constructs.
   In particular the anticipatory scale was related to reward
   responsiveness and imagery, while consummatory pleasure was related to
   openness to different experiences, and appreciation of positive stimuli.

   Hence, we suggest the development and validation of new items that

Abstract = {More than 70 years ago, Maslow put forward an integrated theory of human
   motivation that still captures the public imagination. Still,
   integration with modern theory and research remains elusive. The current
   study aims to fill this gap in the psychological literature, linking
   Maslow's theory to contemporary theory and research on personality and
   well-being. Toward this aim, the new 30-item ``Characteristics of
   Self-Actualization Scale (CSAS){''} was developed. Scale validation
   showed that 10 characteristics of self-actualizing people as proposed by
   Maslow load on a general factor of self-actualization and demonstrate
   external validity. Those reporting more characteristics of
   self-actualization were more motivated by growth, exploration, and love
   of humanity than the fulfillment of deficiencies in basic needs. The
   characteristics of self-actualization were also associated with greater
   well-being across a number of indicators of well-being, including
   greater life satisfaction, self-acceptance, positive relations,
   environmental mastery, personal growth, autonomy, purpose in life, and
   self-transcendent experiences. Self-actualization scores also predicted
   work-related outcomes and creativity across multiple domains of
   achievement. The results provide support for Maslow's proposed
   characteristics of self-actualization and basic motivational framework,
   bringing the concept of self-actualization so frequently discussed by
   the founding humanistic psychologists firmly into the 21st century.},

Abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that metrics of structural validity
   are severely underreported in social and personality psychology. We
   comprehensively assessed structural validity in a uniquely large and
   varied data set (N = 144,496 experimental sessions) to investigate the
   psychometric properties of some of the most widely used self-report
   measures (k = 15 questionnaires, 26 scales) in social and personality
   psychology. When the scales were assessed using the modal practice of
   considering only internal consistency, 88\% of them appeared to possess
   good validity. Yet when validity was assessed comprehensively (via
   internal consistency, immediate and delayed test-retest reliability,
   factor structure, and measurement invariance for age and gender groups),
   only 4\% demonstrated good validity. Furthermore, the less commonly a
   test was reported in the literature, the more likely the scales were to
   fail that test (e.g., scales failed measurement invariance much more
   often than internal consistency). This suggests that the pattern of
   underreporting in the field may represent widespread hidden invalidity
   of the measures used and may therefore pose a threat to many research
   findings. We highlight the degrees of freedom afforded to researchers in
   the assessment and reporting of structural validity and introduce the
   concept of validity hacking (v-hacking), similar to the better-known
   concept of p-hacking. We argue that the practice of v-hacking should be
   acknowledged and addressed.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The present investigation has a dual focus: to evaluate problematic
   practice in the use of item parcels and to suggest exploratory
   structural equation models (ESEMs) as a viable alternative to the
   traditional independent clusters confirmatory factor analysis (ICM-CFA)
   model (with no cross-loadings, subsidiary factors, or correlated
   uniquenesses). Typically, it is ill-advised to (a) use item parcels when
   ICM-CFA models do not fit the data, and (b) retain ICM-CFA models when
   items cross-load on multiple factors. However, the combined use of (a)
   and (b) is widespread and often provides such misleadingly good fit
   indexes that applied researchers might believe that misspecification
   problems are resolved-that 2 wrongs really do make a right. Taking a
   pragmatist perspective, in 4 studies we demonstrate with responses to
   the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (Rosenberg, 1965), Big Five
   personality factors, and simulated data that even small cross-loadings
   seriously distort relations among ICM-CFA constructs or even decisions
   on the number of factors; although obvious in item-level analyses, this
   is camouflaged by the use of parcels. ESEMs provide a viable alternative
   to ICM-CFAs and a test for the appropriateness of parcels. The use of
   parcels with an ICM-CFA model is most justifiable when the fit of both
   ICM-CFA and ESEM models is acceptable and equally good, and when
   substantively important interpretations are similar. However, if the
   ESEM model fits the data better than the ICM-CFA model, then the use of
   parcels with an ICM-CFA model typically is ill-advised-particularly in
   studies that are also interested in scale development, latent means, and
   measurement invariance.},

Abstract = {Individuals often identify with groups in order to either reduce
   perceived uncertainty or to feel better about who they are as
   individuals. This suggests that cognitive and affective identification
   are two distinctive forms of social identification in organizational
   settings. Because neurotic individuals are highly motivated to reduce
   perceived uncertainty, they will tend to identify cognitively with
   groups. Extraverted individuals, on the other hand, are highly motivated
   to enhance how they feel about themselves and thus identify affectively
   with groups. Across three studies, we develop measures of cognitive and
   affective identification and then show that neuroticism is positively
   related to cognitive identification, whereas extraversion is positively
   related to affective identification. We also find that affective
   identification provides incremental predictive validity over and above
   cognitive identification in the prediction of organizational commitment,
   organizational involvement, and organizational citizenship behaviors.

   supported the measurement invariance for gender, but not for age. The
   internal consistency of the scale was adequate. In Study 2 (N = 344), we
   found significant positive correlations between career crafting and two
   similar constructs, namely job crafting and organizational career
   management, supporting the convergent validity of the scale. In Study 3
   (N = 213), the criterion validity of the scale was supported by
   significant positive correlations between career crafting and four of

Abstract = {Objectives: The research investigating how one's multiple cultural

   existing cultural identity configurations aside from integration, and
   for identifying with more than 2 cultural groups at once. The current
   research addresses these issues by constructing the Multicultural
   Identity Integration Scale (MULTIIS) to examine 3 different
   multicultural identity configurations, and their relationship to
   well-being based on Amiot and colleagues' (2007) cognitive-developmental
   model of social identity integration (CDSMII). Method: Diverse samples
   of multicultural individuals completed the MULTIIS along with identity
   and well-being measures. (Study 1A: N = 407; 1B: N = 310; 2A = 338 and
   2A = 254) Results: Reliability and confirmatory factorial analyses
   (Studies 1A and 2A) all supported the factorial structure of the
   MULTIIS. Regression analyses (Studies 1B and 2B) confirmed that the
   integration subscale of the MULTIIS positively predicted well-being,
   whereas compartmentalization negatively predicted well-being.
   Categorization was inconsistently related to well-being. Conclusions:
   These findings support the CDSMII and the usefulness of the MULTIIS
   measure, and suggest that each identity configuration is uniquely
   related to well-being outcomes.},

   Scale). In one qualitative study, we developed a set of interview
   prompts based on previous work on media use. Those interviews resulted
   in the creation of 49 survey items that spanned several dimensions. We
   administered those items in a survey of 395 respondents and used factor
   analyses to reduce the number of items from 49 to 15, revealing five
   dimensions of fatigue: general, social, emotional, visual, and
   motivational fatigue. Finally, in a scale validation study based on 2724
   respondents, we showed the reliability of the overall scale and the five
   factors and demonstrated scale validity in two ways. First, frequency,
   duration, and burstiness of Zoom meetings were associated with a higher
   level of fatigue. Second, fatigue was associated with negative attitudes
   towards the Zoom meetings. We discuss future directions for validation
   and expansion of the scale.},

Abstract = {This article reports the development and validation of a theory-based,
   short form measure of cultural intelligence (SFCQ). The SFCQ captures
   the original theoretical intent of a multifaceted culture general form
   of intelligence that is related to effective intercultural interactions.
   The validity of the scale is established with 3526 participants in five
   language groups from around the world. Results provide evidence for
   construct and criterion-related validity of the measure, and indicate
   that cultural intelligence is a single latent factor reflected in three
   intermediate facets. In support of construct validity the measure is
   modestly related to but distinct from emotional intelligence and
   personality and correlates positively with several indicators of
   multicultural experience. With regard to criterion-related validity, it
   relates as predicted to several dimensions of intercultural
   effectiveness. Implications for the measurement and understanding of
   culture and the influence of culture on management practice are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Marital infidelity is both socially perceived as immoral and very
   frequent. This contradiction might be explained through the process of
   moral disengagement, specifically by the use of certain socially shared
   moral justifications of infidelity, which consequently foster unfaithful
   behavior. This research developed and examined the Infidelity Moral
   Disengagement Scale (IMDS), aiming to capture the strategies of morally
   legitimizing infidelity used among people in marital relationships.
   Across two studies (total N = 609 married participants) we investigated
   the dimensions and psychometric properties of the IMDS. Results showed
   that the dominant strategies of legitimizing marital infidelity are the
   diffusion of responsibility, the attribution of blame on the cheated
   partner, advantageous comparisons with other immoral acts, justifying
   infidelity through certain benefits, and minimizing its negative
   consequences. The IMDS emerged as negatively related to moral identity
   and strongly associated to people???s past infidelity and to their
   tendency to engage in unfaithful behaviors.},

Abstract = {To address conceptual difficulties and advance research on meaning in

   discusses the development of the Multidimensional Existential Meaning

   Results from three samples of undergraduates showed the MEMS to have
   favorable psychometric properties (e.g. good factor structure and
   reliability) and demonstrated that it can effectively differentiate the
   three subconstructs of meaning. Regression and relative importance
   analyses showed that each MEMS subscale carried predictive power for
   relevant variables and other meaning measures. Additionally, the MEMS
   subscales demonstrated theoretically consistent, differential
   associations with other variables (e.g. dogmatism, behavioral
   activation, and spirituality). Overall, results suggest that the MEMS

   open new avenues of research and facilitate a more nuanced understanding

   may not fit in the IC domain; higher-order factor analysis indicated
   that, whereas items measuring Reading loaded more strongly on their

   a general factor of IC. These results are significant for understanding

Abstract = {Morality-as-Cooperation (MAC) is the theory that morality is a

   measure of morality, the Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q),

   Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). Over four studies, the results support
   the MAC-Q's seven-factor model of morality, but not the MFQ's

Abstract = {The present study aimed to develop an instrument to measure emotional
   intelligence (EI). This novel scale distinguishes between four factors,
   namely, self- and other-focused emotion appraisal and emotion
   regulation. In Study 1, the Rotterdam Emotional Intelligence Scale
   (REIS) was developed and examined with respect to its factorial
   structure and reliability (N = 383). In Study 2, the factorial structure
   of the REIS was validated in two new samples (N = 2728 and N = 590).
   Study 3 examined convergent and discriminant validity by comparing the
   REIS dimensions with other EI instruments, cognitive intelligence, and
   personality (N = 108 and N = 105). The criterion validity of the REIS
   was examined in Study 4 (N = 73, N = 95, and N = 103). The results
   indicate that the REIS follows a four-factorial structure and can be
   reliably measured with 28 items. The REIS was strongly correlated with
   other self-reported EI instruments and weakly to moderately correlated
   with an ability EI test, cognitive intelligence, and personality.
   Moreover, self-focused emotion regulation was negatively associated with
   tutors' perceived stress, whereas other-focused emotion regulation was
   positively associated with tutors' work engagement, jobseekers'

Abstract = {Most theoretical models of HIV risk behavior have not considered the
   role of personality factors, and few studies have examined mechanisms
   accounting for dispositional influences on sexual risk taking. This
   study elaborated on a conceptual model emphasizing sexual sensation
   seeking, alcohol expectancies, and drinking before sex as key predictors
   of HIV risk (S. C. Kalichman, L. Tannenbaum, \& D. Nachimson, 1998).
   Multiple groups structural equation modeling was used to determine
   whether gender moderated relationships among these variables in a sample
   of 611 heterosexual, young adult drinkers (49\% women, 76\% Caucasian,
   mean age = 25 years). The model provided an excellent fit to the data,
   and gender differences were not substantiated. Sexual sensation seeking
   predicted HIV risk directly as well as indirectly via sex-related
   alcohol expectancies and drinking in sexual contexts. Findings suggest
   that expectancies and drinking before sex represent proximal mechanisms
   through which dispositional factors influence sexual risk outcomes.
   Moreover, these relationships appear to be similar in men and women.
   Interventions could benefit from targeting alcohol expectancies and
   drinking before sex in individuals with a dispositional tendency toward
   sexual risk taking.},

Abstract = {Passenger presence in vehicles has both positive (i.e., crash-reducing)
   and negative (i.e., crash-inducing) effects on drivers. Although many
   earlier studies have empirically investigated conditions under which
   negative or positive effects predominate, few of them considered why
   passenger presence has these effects. The present paper aimed to
   contribute to the understanding of this question by identifying
   dimensions of psychological effects of passenger presence that can
   influence the likelihood that drivers are involved in crashes. A
   multidimensional scale was developed by means of factor analysis. Data
   were collected from drivers who drive regularly with their spouses as
   passengers. Five dimensions were identified: ``pique,{''} ``flattery,
   vanity, and overdependence,{''} ``relief,{''} ``responsibility,{''} and
   ``annoyance.{''} Each dimension's subscale was shown to have a
   sufficient level of internal consistency and significant associations
   with external criteria on marital relationships and personality
   characteristics. The findings could serve as an important scientific
   basis for consideration of how to maximize the positive effects or
   minimize the negative effects of passenger presence. Published by

Abstract = {Narcissism, a personality trait characterized by entitlement and

   narcissism exist: grandiose narcissism (characterized by arrogance and
   dominance) and vulnerable narcissism (characterized by social insecurity

   subtypes will engage in ostentatious, showy purchases, that is,
   conspicuous consumption. Since the two subtypes differ so profoundly in
   their self-esteem regulation strategies, we further posit that their
   motivations to consume conspicuously may vary. Specifically, we
   hypothesize that grandiose narcissists' conspicuous consumption will be
   driven by their need-for-uniqueness, whilst that of vulnerable
   narcissists by their need to avoid social disapproval. We test our
   hypotheses using data obtained from 382 participants. Our results
   support our expectations that both narcissism subtypes predict
   conspicuous consumption and that the relationship between grandiose
   narcissism and conspicuous consumption is mediated by their
   need-for-uniqueness. Meanwhile, we find that approval-seeking (AS) is
   only a marginally significant mediator of vulnerable narcissism and
   conspicuous consumption in females. We discuss theoretical and

Journal = {MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1273-1288},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Purpose
   There is a compelling need for developing constructs in management
   science for higher relevance rather than adapting constructs developed
   in other domains and applying them in organizations. An inquiry in the
   relevance of the construct of strength developed in personality
   psychology and applied to organizations is compelling, as deploying
   strengths leads to humanizing organizations. With growing disengagement
   of employees at work, this study makes a significant contribution by
   conceptualizing strengths in the context of organizations and carrying
   out two studies on independent samples for developing a psychometrically
   validated 14-item scale for measuring it.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study has two phases. The first phase is conceptual in nature where
   the authors deploy the social systems theory and use recent empirical
   research evidence in conceptualizing the construct of employee strengths
   at work (ESAW). In the second phase, the author carry out two studies on
   independent samples for ascertaining the factor structure by carrying
   out EFA and then confirming it by doing a confirmatory factor analysis.
   Findings
   The construct of ESAW, relevant for management science, has five
   factors: potential deployment, person-jot fit, managerial sensitivity,
   prompt assimilation and joy. The psychometrically validated scale for
   measuring ESAW developed in this study has 14 items. Because the
   construct incorporates key contextual factors, it is more relevant to
   organizational science and contributes to humanizing organizations.
   Originality/value
   This study evolves the construct of ESAW from a predominantly
   trait-based approach to a conceptualization that accounts for the
   contextual factors, essential for enabling strengths of employees to
   manifest. The study contributes to advancing literature that holds
   promise for humanizing organizations - a pressing need because of the
   growing instances of employee disengagement. The author develop a
   14-item psychometrically validated scale for measuring ESAW that the
   practitioners can use in first assessing current levels of employee
   strengths' deployment and thereafter intervening for increasing the
   deployment of their strengths for enabling higher well-being and
   superior performance.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-127},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to critique human personality as a theory
   underpinning brand personality and to propose instead a theory from
   human perception, and by doing so, to identify universally relevant
   dimensions.
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of published measures of brand
   personality, a re-analysis of two existing data bases and the analysis
   of one new database are used to argue and test for the dimensions
   derived from perception theory.
   Findings - Existing work on brand personality suggests 16 separate
   dimensions for the construct, but some appear common to most measures.
   When non-orthogonal rotation is used to re-analyse existing trait data
   on brand personality, three dimensions derived from signalling and
   associated theory can emerge: sincerity (e.g. warm, friendly and
   agreeable), competence (e.g. competent, effective and efficient) and
   status (e.g. prestigious, elegant and sophisticated). The first two are
   common to most measures, status is not.
   Research limitations/implications - Three dimensions derived from
   signalling and associated theory are proposed as generic, relevant to
   all contexts and cultures. They can be supplemented by context specific
   dimensions.
   Practical implications - Measures of these three dimensions should be
   included in all measures of brand personality.
   Originality/value - Prior work on brand personality has focussed on
   identifying apparently new dimensions for the construct. While most work
   is not theoretically based, some have argued for the relevance of human
   personality. That model is challenged, and an alternative approach to
   both theory and analysis is proposed and successfully tested.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the mediating role of shopping

   Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the theory of planned behavior
   (TPB), the authors develop and test a model that links personality
   traits to shoplifting intention and behavior. The results from a sample

   Findings The results from a sample of 507 consumers show that
   shoplifting intention mediates the effects of personality traits
   (materialism, alienation and sensation seeking) on shoplifting behavior.
   In addition, both employee incompetence and consumer similarity are
   found to moderate the relationship between shoplifting intention and
   behavior. The findings offer some useful theoretical and managerial

   Originality/value Drawing on the TPB, the authors investigate how
   personality traits (i.e. materialism, sensation seeking and consumer
   alienation) influence shoplifting behavior via shoplifting intention.
   They find that the effects of materialism, sensation seeking and
   alienation on shoplifting behavior are mediated by shoplifting
   intention. More importantly, they also find strong support for the
   moderating roles of employee incompetence and consumer similarity on the
   relationship between shoplifting intention and behavior. While employee
   incompetence enhances the relationship between shoplifting intention and
   shoplifting behavior, consumer similarity negatively moderates the

Abstract = {The literature suggests that contextualized personality measures yield
   stronger predictive validity. However, frame-of-reference (FOR) theory
   is underdeveloped, and existing work-FOR personality measures have
   several limitations. Integrating FOR research with the
   knowledge-and-appraisal personality architecture (KAPA) theoretical
   framework, we developed a new work-FOR personality measure: the 20-item
   ORG-B5. Study 1 summarizes the procedure used to select the items and
   tests its basic psychometric properties with two samples. Study 2 shows
   that the ORG-B5 has good convergent and discriminant validity and
   outperforms the Mini-Markers and the Mini-IPIP in its base
   psychometrics. Study 3 demonstrates that the ORG-B5 predicts
   work-engagement and leader-member exchange (LMX), while Study 4a and 4b
   shows incremental validity of the ORG-B5 above other Big Five measures
   in predicting work-engagement and LMX. Study 5 demonstrates measurement
   invariance between native and nonnative English speakers and compares
   the criterion and incremental validity of the ORG-B5 beyond another
   work-FOR measure. Study 6 demonstrates convergence between self- and
   coworker ratings of the ORG-B5 and its prediction of time-lagged
   self-reported engagement and LMX and supervisor-reported deviance and
   task performance. Given these results, we argue that the ORG-B5 is a
   reliable and short personality measure more appropriate than existing
   measures for organizational research.},

Abstract = {Numerous scholars have criticized the traditional assessment of

   the correlation profile for the same variables reported by Collison and

Abstract = {Based on Salovey and Mayer's conceptualization of emotional

Abstract = {Many areas of psychological science rely heavily on theoretical
   constructs, such as personality traits, attitudes, and emotions, and
   many of these measured constructs are defined by a continuum that
   represents the different degrees of the attribute. However, these
   continua are not usually considered by psychologists during the process
   of scale development and validation. Unfortunately, this can lead to
   numerous scientific problems, such as incomplete measurement of the
   construct, difficulties in distinguishing between constructs, and
   compromised evidence for validity. The purpose of the current article is
   to propose an approach for carefully considering these issues in
   psychological measurement. This approach, which we term continuum
   specification, is a two-stage process in which the researcher defines
   and then properly operationalizes the target continuum. Defining the
   continuum involves specifying its polarity (i.e., the meaning of its
   poles, or ends) and the nature of its gradations (i.e., the quality that
   separates high from low scores). Operationalizing the continuum means
   using this definition to develop a measure that (a) sufficiently
   captures the entire continuum, (b) has appropriate response options, (c)
   uses correct procedures for assessing dimensionality, and (d) accounts
   for the underlying response process. These issues have significant

   terms of satisfaction, word of mouth, and repurchase behaviors. Although
   companies often offer customer assistance, many consumers do not make
   the step to ask for help. In this research, we introduce a social
   psychological framework centered around the threats associated with
   help-seeking to better explain help-avoidant behaviors. Doing so, we
   introduce and develop the ``propensity to avoid seeking assistance{''}
   construct to better understand what triggers and hinders customers'
   assistance request behavior - or lack thereof. By offering and
   validating a new scale to measure such behavior, this research adds a
   methodological contribution to the literature. It also contributes to
   better explain the behavior of customers who would rather abandon using
   a product or service than ask for help.},

Abstract = {Pressure to manage complex and dynamic brand portfolios has posed a
   serious challenge for firms in protecting their brand identity and
   retaining loyal customers. To help firms overcome this challenge, the
   authors propose the new construct of brand portfolio coherence (BPC) to
   describe consumers' perceptions that (sub-)brands in a brand portfolio
   share a common underlying logic of features reflected in design,
   personality, and status. Through three comprehensive studies, the
   research develops and validates a multi-dimensional measure of BPC and
   differentiates it from relevant constructs, such as brand fit,
   connection, positioning, trust, and loyalty. Nomological examination
   shows that perceived BPC improves (re)purchase decisions with regard to
   brands in the portfolio. Furthermore, the research uncovers the
   mechanisms through which BPC exerts its impact and identifies customer-,
   product-, and brand strategy-related boundaries of the effect. Overall,
   the BPC construct and measure offer useful tools and managerial
   implications for firms to effectively manage brand portfolios to retain
   and grow customer base. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in social hierarchy research highlight that power and
   status are two prevalent but distinct bases of hierarchy. However, these
   distinctions have yet to be thoroughly explored in contexts where power
   and status coexist and can covary. This is, in part, due to the lack of
   an appropriate measure capable of capturing power and status as distinct
   constructs. In order to advance research on social hierarchy and bridge
   the empirical findings from social psychology research to organizational
   research, this paper outlines the development of a 12-item bipartite
   measure of perceived power and perceived status. Using seven samples, we
   develop a psychometrically sound measure and provide evidence of
   construct validity. Our results not only support the importance of
   distinguishing between these two prevalent bases of social hierarchy,
   but also highlight the potential dangers of capturing one base of
   hierarchy without accounting for the other.},

   scale's ability to capture group differences, namely between genders and
   school retentions, and finally by comparing a sub-group of convicted
   adolescents with a group of non-convicted ones regarding their

   three surveys (Study 1: N = 330; Study 2a: N = 2,083; Study 2b: N =

   rivalling attitude conceptualizations (one-factor, three-factor, and
   second-order factor model). We found that a three-factor or second-order
   factor conceptualization fitted best to the data. The scale had
   excellent psychometric properties. We hope that our work stimulates a

   this scale, and contributes to the debate on the conceptualization of

   adolescent girls have internalized or resisted two negative conventions
   of femininity in two psychological domains: experience of self in
   relationship with others and relationship with one's body. Grounded in
   girls' own words, the 20-item scale is comprised of two subscales
   reflecting these domains. The AFIS has acceptable internal consistency
   and temporal stability. We demonstrate construct and concurrent
   validity, as well as discriminant validity from the Bem Sex Role
   Inventory(Bem, 1981) and the Attitudes Towards Women Scale for

Abstract = {We introduce a new construct to the vocational behavior literature: job
   desperation. Job desperation is defined as a state of despair in which a
   person feels pressure to find a new job, has a negative evaluation of
   his/her current employment situation, and will go to extreme lengths to
   find a new job. Using self-determination theory, we provide a
   theoretical rationale for job desperation. Across two studies, we
   developed and validated the job desperation scale (JDS). In Study 1, we
   generated a pool of items and evaluated them using a combination of
   psychometric techniques including item response theory. In Study 2, we
   examined the construct validity of the JDS. Results suggest that job
   desperation is a strong predictor of job search behavior, predicting
   unique variance in job search behavior over and above other relevant
   antecedents such as financial strain and job insecurity. We believe job
   desperation adds to and expands our knowledge of the antecedents of job
   search behavior by serving as a unique and relevant explanation for why
   people search for jobs.},

   which one feels that others are worthy of our trust). However, there is
   as yet no measure that distinguishes between these two components of
   trust. In three studies, we examined the psychometrics of a proposed
   two-dimensional measure of trust that encompasses propensity to trust
   and other-focused trust components. To test discriminant validity, we
   also administered measures of personality, personal self-esteem, social
   capital, propensity to like people, perceived social support, as well as
   general and personal beliefs in a just world. Factor analyses supported
   the proposed two-factor model for the new trust measure. Further
   analyses supported the difference between these measures.},

   The e-diary affect assessments revealed a considerable portion of

   compared to the less complex models. Factor loadings also improved with
   the complexity of the models. Accordingly, we recommend that future

   holistically captures both aspects of the stress response, bridging the
   gap between theory and measurement and counteracting the typically
   negatively focused approach to stress research. The ADES was
   systematically developed and tested in a socio-educationally diverse
   sample of 981 adolescents (M-age = 15.19, 50.62\% female). The finalized
   self-report scale consists of two 5-item subscales, individually
   indexing distress and eustress. Initial psychometric properties of the
   ADES are promising, and the scale has the potential to meet the needs of
   researchers, schools, and organizations.},

Abstract = {Brands have become increasingly important as a foundation for
   competitive strategy. Unfortunately, although brand managers are
   responsible for brand strategy development and execution, little is
   known about what makes a brand manager effective. A model is developed
   to understand what intangible capital embodied by brand managers
   influences brand management capabilities and resultant brand
   performance. Measures of brand manager intangible capital and brand
   management capabilities are developed through an iterative scale
   development process. Hypothesis testing, derived from a survey of brand
   managers, indicates that brand manager human, relational and
   informational capital influences brand management capabilities and
   resultant brand performance, and brand manager intangible capital has an
   indirect effect on brand performance via brand management capabilities.
   By delineating and operationalizing the intangible capital and
   capabilities of brand managers, this study provides a theoretical and
   empirical foundation for future research on brand managers, tools for
   assessing current brand manager capital and capabilities, and guidance
   in relation to intangible capital and capabilities needed by brand
   managers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Risk attitudes are of interest to researchers in many fields as they
   play a crucial role in our day-to-day decision-making. In this paper we
   develop a measure of risk attitudes-the Multi-Domain Risk Tolerance
   (MDRT) scale-that addresses some key shortcomings of popular self-report
   scales, such as the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale. We do
   this by clearly aligning the risk in the items with the particular
   domain of risk, reducing item ambiguity, and reducing the impact of
   prior knowledge. We developed the MDRT using an Exploratory Graph
   Analysis (EGA) and Item Response Theory (IRT) approach with a community
   sample (N = 921). We examined its construct and convergent validity (N =
   493) and construct generalizability (N = 487). We found that the MDRT
   had excellent internal consistency, dimensionality and latent factor
   structure. The MDRT also demonstrated significant convergent validity
   with related scales used in the literature. The MDRT is shown to be a
   promising alternative measure of risk attitudes.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {New assessments were developed measuring conscientiousness and openness
   by gamifying two existing Likert-type personality measures by adding a
   story, a measure redesign process called storification. Both the
   original and storified versions of the measures were administered to 426
   people to compare the measures' convergence, incremental prediction of
   performance, magnitude of faking effects, and reactions using a
   counter-balanced within-subjects fake-good research design. Moderate
   convergence of latent traits was observed between the original and
   storified measures for both conscientiousness (beta = .45) and openness
   (beta = .72). Convergence at the item level was generally poor (-.02 < r
   < .40 with mean convergence = 0.17). The measures predicted performance
   more poorly than the original measures on which they were based. When
   instructed to fake, the conscientiousness measure showed improved
   resistance to faking, but the openness measure did not. Reactions (e.g.,
   face validity perceptions, predictive validity perceptions) were more
   positive to the storified measures in terms of procedural justice and
   general fairness perceptions. Overall, the present attempt at
   storification was more successful at creating alternative measures of
   traits rather than parallel ones, suggesting storification may be better
   considered a distinct scale development strategy instead of a redesign
   technique that maintains the psychometric profile of an original
   measure.},

   analysis of human action and test general predictions about the
   psychological value of experiencing a sense of belonging in time, what
   we call temporal rootedness. Two samples (Studies 1 and 2) collected
   across cultures provide converging evidence that temporal rootedness is
   a unique psychological phenomenon that is predictive of personal
   psychological well-being. Two additional experiments (Studies 3 and 4)
   offer promising evidence that temporal rootedness can be situationally

Abstract = {Although ethical leadership positively relates to a variety of favorable

   remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate behavioral manifestations
   of ethical leadership in the Chinese context and develop the Chinese
   Ethical Leadership Scale (CELS). In Study 1, we use an indigenous,
   qualitative approach to investigate the nature of ethical leadership.
   Based on the qualitative findings, we develop the CELS, which consists
   of six important components of Chinese ethical leadership: moral
   courage, openness to criticism, incorruptibility, reliability, fairness,
   and role modeling. In Study 2, we empirically show that, after
   controlling for a Western ethical leadership scale, the six dimensions
   of Chinese ethical leadership predict various subordinate outcomes,
   including reporting of wrongdoing, cooperative voice, protection of
   company resources, conscientiousness, interpersonal harmony, and task
   performance. Based on our results, we propose a culturally integrated
   model of ethical leadership that elucidates both ethical and Chinese

Abstract = {Locus of control has been extensively examined in entrepreneurship

   has been shown to be multidimensional, including personal efficacy. When
   the first Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I) was
   constructed in the late 1990s, a measure of locus of control was
   included. Unfortunately, this scale was also multidimensional. Thus,
   measurement of the construct may be problematic. Because locus of
   control continues to be important in organizational research, where it
   has been found to influence intentions, motivation, satisfaction, and
   performance, we examined the PSED I dataset to determine whether we
   could develop a more robust measure after the fact. To this end, we
   constructed a unidimensional locus of control scale using the sample of
   nascent entrepreneurs in the PSED I dataset and validated the scale
   using two additional samples.},

Abstract = {This article reports the construction and validation of a comprehensive

   confirmatory factor analyses (N = 345) were conducted using 2
   sociodemographically diverse samples. The results provided support for a
   2-factor conceptualization of the construct, with the dimensions
   imaginative fantasy and creative fantasy. Imaginative fantasy refers to
   vivid imagination and absorption in these images and daydreams. Creative
   fantasy refers to the activity of using fantasy to create new ideas. The
   trait measure showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability,
   discriminant and convergent construct validity, as well as incremental
   validity. Moreover, in 3 behavioral studies, we put fantasy scores in
   relationship with behavioral data to provide further proof of validity.

Pages = {157-176},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The concept of risk propensity has been the subject of both theoretical
   and empirical investigation, but with little consensus about its
   definition and measurement. To address this need, a new scale assessing
   overall risk propensity in terms of reported frequency of risk
   behaviours in six domains was developed and applied: recreation, health,
   career, finance, safety and social. The paper describes the properties
   of the scale and its correlates: demographic variables, biographical
   self-reports, and the NEO PI-R, a Five Factor personality inventory
   (N=2041). There are three main results. First, risk propensity has clear
   links with age and sex, and with objective measures of career-related
   risk taking (changing jobs and setting up a business). Second, the data
   show risk propensity to be strongly rooted in personality. A clear Big
   Five pattern emerges for overall risk propensity, combining high
   extraversion and openness with low neuroticism, agreeableness, and
   conscientiousness. At the subscale level, sensation-seeking surfaces as
   a key important component of risk propensity. Third, risk propensity
   differs markedly in its distribution across job types and business
   sectors. These findings are interpreted as indicating that risk takers
   are of three nonexclusive types: stimulation seekers, goal achievers,
   and risk adapters. Only the first group is truly risk seeking, the
   others are more correctly viewed as risk bearers. The implications for
   risk research and management are discussed.},

   validation studies of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire,
   were regressed on the 15 trait EI facets using the stepwise method. The

   variance in any of the six samples. As expected, a composite of the

   response to 14 pleasant experiencesin adolescents. Adolescents (N = 585,

   Item response theory models were used to evaluate the psychometric
   performance of each SHAPS item. Correlations of the SHAPS with other
   personality and psychopathology measures were calculated to evaluate
   construct validity. Results showed that (a) certain items (e.g.,
   reported pleasure from basic experiences like seeing smiling faces or
   smelling flowers) provided more information about latent anhedonia than
   others; and (b) SHAPS scales exhibited construct-consistent convergent
   and discriminant validity (i.e., stronger correlations with low positive
   affect constructs, weaker correlations with negative affect). Reporting
   diminished pleasure from basic pleasant experiences accurately indicates
   adolescent anhedonia, which is important for future scale development
   and understanding the phenomenology of anhedonia in teens. These data
   support using the SHAPS for assessing anhedonia in epidemiological

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explain the effects of col-or, lighting,
   and music as store environment cues on the perceptions among consumers
   of store personality, store image, and on their own store
   preferences.Design/Methodology/Approach - An experimental approach was
   employed to determine these effects, using a between-subjects factorial
   design including two levels of color, lighting, and music. The data were
   collected from 600 participants through face-to-face surveys. A video
   design of a fictional store environment was shown to the subjects and
   survey questions were applied to eight different experimental groups by
   pro-viding manipulation control.Results and implications - The results
   demonstrate that consumer perceptions of store image, store
   person-ality, and store preferences differ with changing color,
   lighting, and music variables. Additionally, these vari-ables differ in
   their interactions with each other and in their total
   interactions.Limitations - While the present study sheds light on the
   influence of color, lighting, and music cues of the fash-ion store
   environment on consumer perceptions of store personality and image, as
   well as their store preferences, interactions between store environment
   cues and other attributes in stores should also be explored.Originality
   - This study examines the impact of store environment variables in their
   different aspects on con-sumer perceptions of store image and store
   personality, as well as consumer store preferences, by focusing on
   Mehrabian and Russell's (1974) Stimulus-Organism -Re-sponse (SOR) model

Abstract = {Finding meaning in our lives is a central tenet to the human experience
   and a core contributor to mental health. Individuals tend to actively
   seek the sources of meaning in their lives or consciously enact efforts
   to create or ``craft{''} meaning in different life domains. These
   overall ``Life Crafting{''} behaviors refer to the conscious efforts
   individuals exert to create meaning in their lives through (a)
   cognitively (re-)framing how they view life, (b) seeking social support
   systems to manage life challenges, and (c) actively seeking challenges
   to facilitate personal growth. Specifically, these behaviors are
   actioned to better align life goals, personal needs, values, and
   capabilities. However, no psychological assessment instrument currently
   exists to measure overall life crafting. As such, the purpose of this
   paper was twofold: to conceptualize life crafting and to develop,
   validate and evaluate a robust measure of overall life crafting. A
   mixed-method, multi-study research design was employed. First, nine
   participants were interviewed to determine the methods or techniques
   used to craft meaningful life experiences. These methods/techniques were
   used as indicators to create an initial item pool which was then
   reviewed by a panel of experts to ensure face validity. Second, in Study
   1, the factorial structure of the instrument was explored by gathering
   data from a convenience sample (N = 331), with the results showing
   support for a three-factor structure of life crafting, consisting of (a)
   cognitive crafting, (b) seeking social support, and (c) seeking
   challenges. Finally, in Study 2 (N = 362), the aim was to confirm the
   factorial structure of the Life Crafting scale and to determine its
   level of internal consistency, partial measurement invariance across
   genders, and criterion validity {[}meaning in life (beta = 0.91), mental
   health (beta = 0.91), work engagement (beta = 0.54), and job burnout
   (beta = -0.42)]. The results supported a second-order factorial model of
   Life Crafting, which comprised of three first-order factors (cognitive
   crafting, seeking social support, and seeking challenges). Therefore,
   the Life Crafting Scale can be used as a valid and reliable instrument
   to measure- and track the effectiveness of life crafting interventions.},

Title = {The AI-IP: Minimizing the guesswork of personality scale item
   development through artificial intelligence},
Journal = {PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 18},
Abstract = {We propose a framework for integrating various modern natural language
   processing (NLP) models to assist researchers with developing valid
   psychological scales. Transformer-based deep neural networks offer
   state-of-the-art performance on various natural language tasks. This
   project adapts the transformer model GPT-2 to learn the structure of
   personality items, and generate the largest openly available pool of
   personality items, consisting of one million new items. We then use that
   artificial intelligence-based item pool (AI-IP) to provide a subset of
   potential scale items for measuring a desired construct. To better
   recommend construct-related items, we train a paired neural
   network-based classification BERT model to predict the observed
   correlation between personality items using only their text. We also
   demonstrate how zero-shot models can help balance desired content
   domains within the scale. In combination with the Al-IP, these models
   narrow the large item pool to items most correlated with a set of
   initial items. We demonstrate the ability of this multimodel framework
   to develop longer cohesive scales from a small set of construct-relevant
   items. We found reliability, validity, and fit equivalent for
   AI-assisted scales compared to scales developed and optimized by
   traditional methods. By leveraging neural networks' ability to generate
   text relevant to a given topic and infer semantic similarity, this
   project demonstrates how to support creative and open-ended elements of
   the scale development process to increase the likelihood of one's
   initial scale being valid, and minimize the need to modify and
   revalidate the scale.},

Title = {Visual product aesthetics A hierarchical analysis of its trait and value
   antecedents and its behavioral consequences},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {44},
Number = {11-12},
Pages = {1744-1762},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nomological
   net of the construct of the centrality of visual product aesthetics
   (CVPA).
   Design/methodology/approach - A hierarchical model of personality is
   employed to investigate the nomological net of CVPA. The hierarchical
   model incorporates both trait antecedents (e.g. the traits of need for
   material resources, the need for uniqueness, and openness to experience)
   as well as value antecedents (the values of science importance,
   liberalism, and conservatism). In addition, the model includes three
   expected consequences of CVPA not previously investigated in the
   literature. Data were collected from a survey of 542 adult consumers who
   were broadly representative of the population of the USA.
   Findings - The findings identified six significant antecedents of CVPA:
   need for uniqueness, conservative values, liberal values, science
   values, openness to experience, and material needs. In addition, CVPA
   was positively related to individuals' interest in representational art,
   abstract art, and environmental concern.
   Originality/value - The paper advances theory by proposing how traits
   and values work together to influence behavior. It advances
   understanding of CVPA by showing that a concern for visual aesthetics
   influences attitudes that extend beyond product aesthetics to a concern
   for the environment. Finally, methodological issues in identifying a
   construct's nomological net, as well as the study's managerial
   contributions, are discussed.},

Abstract = {In a questionnaire study, Russian versions of the General and Personal

   tested by inspecting correlations of BJW scales with the Basic World

   correlations with Markers for the Big Five Factor Structure Scale and
   Justice Sensitivity Scales. Both personal and general BJW showed
   positive connections with all subscales of the Basic World Assumptions
   Scale (self-worth, benevolence of world, justice, luck, and control). We
   demonstrated divergent validity of personal BJW regarding intellect,
   agreeableness, conscientiousness, beneficiary and perpetrator
   sensitivity, and divergent validity of general BJW regarding intellect,
   beneficiary, perpetrator, and observer sensitivity. Both BJW dimensions
   were unrelated to beneficiary and perpetrator sensitivity. In addition,

Abstract = {In the current study, we present the development of the Global
   Self-Esteem (GSE) measure. The six-item GSE fulfills a need for a short
   unidimensional measure of global self-esteem conceptualized as ``overall

   the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE); however, several important
   shortcomings of the scale have been highlighted in the recent research.
   To improve the operationalization of global self-esteem, the
   shortcomings of the RSE and of the other measures intended to measure
   the construct are addressed in the construction of the GSE. Initial
   psychometric characteristics of the GSE, obtained in a pilot study, are
   reported. The results of exploratory factor analysis indicated
   unidimensionality of the measure-a single factor accounted for 78\% of
   the variance in the GSE items, and the magnitude of factor loadings
   ranged from .81 to .91. Internal consistency reliability was high
   (ordinal alpha = .95), and expected relations between the GSE scores and

Title = {Moxie: individual variability in motivation intensity},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 16},
Abstract = {Motivation intensity differs across individuals. While prior work has
   examined how situational factors contribute to these discrepancies, the
   present work takes an individual differences approach. We developed a
   new tool to measure a novel construct we call ``moxie{''} to assess
   individual differences in motivation intensity. Seven studies were
   conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the proposed Moxie
   Scale. A single factor structure was demonstrated through exploratory
   and confirmatory factor analyses, and the Moxie Scale was shown to have
   high internal consistency and strong test-retest reliability.
   Convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and incremental validity
   were established by exploring associations between moxie and the Big
   Five personality traits, as well as related motivational constructs such
   as grit, self-control, volition and inhibition systems, and
   procrastination. Moxie also predicted intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
   above other motivational constructs. Finally, moxie predicted goal
   achievement over time and mediational analyses indicated that this
   occurred because those high in moxie invested more resources into their
   goal. Collectively, these findings suggest that moxie is an important
   and distinct motivational construct and offer new insights regarding
   individual differences in motivational intensity.},

Abstract = {Psychological reactions towards personnel selection are acquiring
   growing importance, as they significantly impact applicants' performance

   Job Interview Self-efficacy (MJISE) construct and its operationalisation

   demanding interaction with the interviewers, dealing with
   interview-related anxiety, preparing for the contents and the logistics
   of the job interview. After developing the items for the MJISE measure,
   we examined its validity. We tested content validity with an independent
   panel of job interview experts. Subsequently, two studies dealing with
   Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that the
   multi-dimensionality of MIJSE is represented by a bifactor structure
   (one general factor and five specific factors, orthogonal to the general
   factor). We evaluated the external (convergent, discriminant, and
   predictive) validity for establishing the MJISE factors' plausibility
   over and beyond other interview-related variables, such as personality
   traits, obtaining mixed results. The discussion describes the
   implication of using the MJISE scale in practical job search programs

Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Curiosity is a fundamental human motivation that influences learning,
   the acquisition of knowledge, and life fulfillment. Our ability to
   understand the benefits (and costs) of being a curious person hinges on
   adequate assessment. Synthesizing decades of prior research, our goal
   was to improve a well-validated, multi-dimensional measure of curiosity
   (Kashdan et al., 2018). First, we sought to distinguish between two
   types of social curiosity: the overt desire to learn from other people
   versus covert, surreptitious interest in what other people say and do.
   Second, we sought to remove weaker items and reduce the length of each
   subscale. Using data from a survey of 483 working adults (Study 1) and
   460 community adults (Study 2), we found evidence to support the
   preexisting four dimensions of curiosity (Joyous Exploration,
   Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Thrill Seeking) along
   with the separation of the fifth dimension into Overt Social Curiosity
   and Covert Social Curiosity. Each factor of the Five-Dimensional
   Curiosity Scale Revised (5DCR) had substantive relations with a battery
   of personality (e.g., Big Five, intellectual humility) and well-being
   (e.g., psychological need satisfaction) measures. With greater bandwidth
   and predictive power, the 5DCR offers new opportunities for basic
   research and the evaluation of curiosity enhancing interventions.},

Abstract = {A number of explicit conceptions of well-being have been provided by
   philosophers and psychologists, but little is known about laypersons'
   conceptions of well-being. Two studies investigating the content and
   measurement of lay conceptions of well-being are presented. Using
   exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic procedures, the 16-item
   Beliefs about Well-Being Scale (BWBS) was developed to measure lay
   conceptions of well-being along four theoretically-meaningful
   dimensions: (1) the Experience of Pleasure, (2) Avoidance of Negative
   Experience, (3) Self-Development, and (4) Contribution to Others.
   Initial evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the BWBS
   indicated that this new scale has acceptable psychometric properties. In
   both studies, associations between each subscale, representing the above
   four dimensions, and multiple self-report measures of experienced
   well-being were also examined. Each subscale was significantly
   associated with well-being, with Self-Development and Contribution to
   Others indicating stronger associations with measures of well-being than
   either Experience of Pleasure or Avoidance of Negative Experience.
   Implications for future research using this economical new scale are

Abstract = {Career success is a main focus of career scholars as well as
   organizational stakeholders. Historically, career success has been
   conceptualized and measured in an objective manner, mainly as salary,
   rank, or number of promotions. However, the changing nature of work has
   also necessitated a change in the way many employees view success,
   adding a more subjective component. Although there has been theoretical
   discussion and calls to develop a comprehensive measure of subjective
   career success, no contemporary comprehensive quantitative measure
   exists. The goal of this study was to create and validate a measure of
   subjective career success, titled the Subjective Career Success
   Inventory (SCSI). The SCSI includes 24 items that address subjective
   career success via eight dimensions. The scale was developed and
   validated through four phases of data collection, beginning with
   interviews and focus groups, followed by item sorting tasks, then item
   refinement through confirmatory factor analysis, and finally convergent
   and discriminant validity quantitative analysis. Theoretical and
   practical implications are discussed. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {Zhanan-a term that refers to heterosexual males who cause mental or
   physical damage to their romantic partners, regardless of intention-is
   becoming a high-profile issue in terms of love and marriage. Therefore,
   assessing whether women's partners are zhanan and preventing potential
   harm is important. The authors of the present study created the
   Self-rating Zhanan Evaluation Scale (SZES). Throughout the process of
   developing the scale, qualitative data were collected from eligible
   female subjects, and 27 items were retained via exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA). Then, in a sample (N = 419) of Chinese male
   participants, the SZES was shown to be well structured, with a
   four-factor model by both exploratory structural equation modeling
   (ESEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) validations. The structure
   was highly internally consistent and was stable over an 8-week period of
   retesting. The SZES is expected to help women identify inappropriate
   spouses and provide references for men to understand themselves better,
   as well as to help repair dysfunctional relationships.},

Abstract = {Research has dealt with the consequences of seeking casual partners

   hypothesis states that people high in dating anxiety and low in physical

   communication (e.g. reduced cues, anonymity, controllability) allow them
   to compensate for the deficits experienced in offline dating. The
   recreation hypothesis proposes that sexually-permissive people and high
   sensation-seekers will look for casual partners online because they
   value the anonymity of the internet. Multivariate analyses of a survey
   of 729 Dutch adults supported the recreation hypothesis, but not the
   compensation hypothesis. Sexually-permissive people and high
   sensation-seekers looked for casual partners online more frequently than
   sexually-restrictive people and low sensation-seekers. Dating anxiety

Abstract = {While social support is generally considered a helpful resource for

   social support (UWSS) is any action taken by a supervisor and/or

   and one quantitative, identified types of UWSS and demonstrated that
   unhelpful support can operate as a job stressor in relating to strains.
   In Study 1, critical incidents were collected from 116 employees, and a
   content analysis revealed 11 distinct categories of UWSS. In Study 2,
   the taxonomy of UWSS was further refined using quantitative methods.
   Results of two samples (176 diverse employees and 496 registered nurses)
   demonstrate that UWSS is associated with higher job-related negative
   affect, lower competence-based self-esteem, lower coworker satisfaction,
   higher work-related burnout, higher organisational frustration, and more
   physical symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea, and fatigue) among recipients.
   Together, the studies demonstrate that unhelpful workplace social
   support is a meaningful job stressor worthy of further investigation.},

Abstract = {Attachment theory was built around the idea that infants rely on others
   to survive, and it is often forgotten that survival hinged on coping
   with environmental demands. Adult attachment reports have instead been
   organized around people's subjective experience of safety and security
   in relationships. To resolve the gap between infant's physical needs and
   adult attachment experiences, we made a first step by developing the
   Social Thermoregulation and Risk Avoidance Questionnaire (STRAQ-1) in 12
   countries (N = 1510), providing a complementary measure to identify
   biological drives formative to attachment. We conjectured that
   co-regulatory patterns of temperature and stress are foundational to
   attachment styles and on this basis used a naive bootstrapping method to
   find a robust solution, conducting seven exploratory factor analyses in
   an exploratory-confirmatory fashion. We identified 23 (out of 57) items
   in 4 subscales: Social Thermoregulation (Total Omega = .83), High
   Temperature Sensitivity (.83), Solitary Thermoregulation (.77), and Risk
   Avoidance (.57). In terms of external validity, we also found that the
   STRAQ-1 relates to emotion regulation strategies broadly and,
   importantly, relates to individual differences in attachment
   specifically, which in turn mediates the relationship with stress and
   health (making the scale face valid). Our approach provides a robust
   first effort in identifying biological mechanisms underlying attachment
   formation.},

Abstract = {Aesthetic experiences are the attitudes, perceptions, or acts of
   attention involved with viewing art. When the viewer is fully engaged,
   aesthetic experiences are comparable with flow experiences, which are
   optimal experiences described by people as ``being in the zone{''} or
   ``getting lost{''} in the moment. This study uses the framework of
   aesthetic experiences by Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson (1990), which
   conceptualizes aesthetic experiences as having 4 art-related dimensions
   and a fifth flow dimension. Using this conceptualization, we created the
   Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (AEQ) and tested its validity in a
   general population of Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Results demonstrated
   that the AEQ consists of 4 artistically related dimensions (i.e.,
   perceptual, emotional, cultural, understanding) and 2 flow dimensions
   (i.e., proximal conditions, experience). The AEQ demonstrated convergent
   validity with related constructs (i.e., openness to experience,
   inspiration, curiosity and exploration), and individuals with greater
   artistic experience had more intense ratings of aesthetic experiences.
   Overall, this study lends support to Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson's
   framework of aesthetic experiences and provides a useful measure of

Abstract = {Although there are measures of sexual interest and sexual conflict in

   to use such strategies. In order to study these changes, we developed
   the Tactics to Obtain Sex Scale (TOSS) to assess self-reported
   likelihood of engaging in sexual coercion and sexual coaxing with a
   romantic partner. In Study 1, a sample of men and women (N = 419) in
   heterosexual relationships completed the TOSS and measures of its
   predicted correlates, including antisociality and mating success. An
   exploratory factor analysis of TOSS scores yielded a two-factor
   solution. As predicted, the two-factor solution identified coaxing
   (COAX) and coercion (COERCE) subscales. There was good internal
   reliability for TOSS, COAX, and COERCE scales (Cronbach alphas > .89).
   Significant correlations between COAX and self-perceived mating success

Abstract = {Whereas most existing self-control research and scales focus on singular

   post-failure behavior. The tendency to experience these responses is
   captured in a new scale, the Response-to-Failure scale, which the

   and cheating. The results support the use of the same emotional and
   cognitive factors to predict post-failure behavior across these three
   domains, providing evidence of the generalizability of the scale
   structure. The data support the scale's structure, nomological and
   discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability across five studies.
   In five additional studies, the scale's predictive validity is
   demonstrated beyond other existing relevant scales. The authors also

Abstract = {Research on affect regulation has blossomed in recent years. However,
   the lack of validated scales assessing individual differences in the use

   development and validation of a brief new measure of individual
   differences in the use of strategies to regulate one's own and other
   people's feelings: the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS)
   scale. Two distinct samples (N = 551 and N = 227) confirmed a
   four-factor structure: intrinsic affect-improving, intrinsic
   affect-worsening, extrinsic affect-improving and extrinsic
   affect-worsening. In line with predictions, these factors were
   associated with existing measures of affect regulation, personality and
   affect. Both intrinsic factors were positively associated with emotional
   exhaustion, while all factors except extrinsic affect-improving were
   positively associated with health-related impairments. Convergence

Abstract = {Numerous theoretical frameworks argue that engaging in controlled

   viewers. To rectify this, the current study developed a measure of
   individual differences in controlled processing within aesthetics, the
   Aesthetic Processing Preference Scale (APPS). The APPS was constructed
   along three dimensions of controlled processing in aesthetic experience:
   Appreciation for Complexity in art, Intolerance for Ambiguity in art,

Title = {Including transcendental needs in a unified model of motivation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {385-396},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to existing models of
   human motivation by measuring transcendental needs along with the more
   commonly studied basic and social needs in order to take into account
   the multitude of needs experienced in the workplace.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey combining the Big Five Inventory
   (John and Srivastava, 1999) with the authors' 30-item need-level
   questionnaire was administered to 366 participants (162 males, 204
   females). The authors examined the relation between need levels,
   particularly transcendental needs, and personality to detect the
   predictors of the different personality traits.
   Findings The results showed that extraversion (r=0.24; p<0.001) and
   agreeableness (r=0.19; p<0.001) are predicted by high social needs,
   whereas openness to experience is predicted by high transcendental needs
   (r=0.35; p<0.001). While the authors made no hypotheses about
   conscientiousness and neuroticism, they found that neuroticism was
   significantly correlated with transcendental needs (r=-0.15; p<0.01).
   Research limitations/implications The relations between needs and other
   individual dimensions, such as values or interests, could be further
   examined. The nature of the sample could be extended in additional
   studies.
   Practical implications Since need levels were able to predict
   personality traits, measuring need levels instead of personality could
   be a better predictor of both adaptability and performance in specific
   contexts.
   Social implications In a position that requires a specific vocation and
   sense of purpose (priest, counselor, etc.), transcendental needs could
   be a better predictor of job achievement than personality traits.
   Monitoring all levels of needs could also be valuable in helping
   managers develop a deeper understanding of their team members'
   expectations for meaning and purpose.
   Originality/value This research contributes to the model on human
   motivation by adding one more level (transcendental) and by testing the
   hypothesis of a link between a need scale and personality traits.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the brand personalities
   that employees are creating of their employer brands, in particular
   business-to-business (B-to-B) brands, when describing these brands on
   social media. We examine how the brand personalities, based on written
   online reviews, differ between high- and low-ranked, and high- and
   low-rated brands. Methodology/Approach: 6,300 written employee reviews
   from a social media platform, Glassdoor, are used for content analysis
   in DICTION, to determine the brand personality dimensions they
   communicate (J. L). An independent B-to-B brand ranking data source,
   Brandwatch, is used as a reference to various brands' level of ranking,
   while an ANOVA test is used to determine whether there is a difference
   in the brand personality trait means when comparing high and low-ranked,
   and high- and low-rated brands. Findings: Our findings suggest that a
   strong social media presence does not equate to a strong employer brand
   personality perception among employees, since there are no significant
   differences between B-to-B firms based on their rankings.
   Originality/Value/Contribution: The study attempts to grow the
   literature of employee brand engagement in a B-to-B context, by
   recognizing the important role that employees play in engaging with
   their employer brand online. Two main contributions are offered. The
   first contribution relates to the finding that employees perceive
   highly-rated B-to-B brands as being more competent, exciting, sincere
   and sophisticated than low-rated B-to-B brands. Second, the methodology
   used in this study proves to be a novel and accurate way of comparing
   employee reviews and perceived employer brand personality, with the
   employer-created intended brand image.},

Title = {Problematic Factorial Validity of Three Language Versions of the Basic
   Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS): Why and What are the Implications?},

Abstract = {Self-determination theory is a macrotheory of human motivation that
   describes fundamental matters such as personality development, goals and
   aspirations, and self-regulation. Basic psychological needs theory, a
   subtheory of self-determination theory, postulates that the needs for
   autonomy, competence, and relatedness are universal and the satisfaction
   thereof essential for human functioning. Despite the theory's strong
   universality claim, almost no studies tested the assumption on the
   African continent. The present study addressed this by exploring the
   factorial validity of English, Afrikaans, and Setswana versions of the
   Basic Psychological Needs Scale (N = 1056). After incorporating a
   negative-worded method effect and removing several problematic items,
   the fit of the intended three-factor model was good for the Afrikaans
   version, marginal for the English version, and poor for the Setswana
   version. The resulting factors' reliabilities were low. Configural,
   metric, and partial scalar invariance were established between the
   English and Afrikaans versions. Although these findings primarily
   highlighted problems with the particular scale, there is also the
   possibility that it could have implications for the validity of the
   universality assumption of basic psychological needs theory and/or
   assumptions about denotations or manifestations of the main constructs
   in various cultural contexts. The study indicated the conceptual and
   linguistic complexities involved in assessment across diverse and
   multicultural contexts.},

Abstract = {Interdependence is a fundamental characteristic of social interactions.
   Interdependence Theory states that 6 dimensions describe differences
   between social situations. Here we examine if these 6 dimensions
   describe how people think about their interdependence with others in a
   situation. We find that people (in situ and ex situ) can reliably
   differentiate situations according to 5, but not 6, dimensions of
   interdependence: (a) mutual dependence, (b) power, (c) conflict, (d)
   future interdependence, and (e) information certainty. This model offers
   a unique framework for understanding how people think about social
   situations compared to another recent model of situation construal
   (DIAMONDS). Furthermore, we examine factors that are theorized to shape
   perceptions of interdependence, such as situational cues (e.g.,
   nonverbal behavior) and personality (e.g., HEXACO and Social Value
   Orientation). We also study the implications of subjective
   interdependence for emotions and cooperative behavior during social
   interactions. This model of subjective interdependence explains
   substantial variation in the emotions people experience in situations
   (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, and disgust), and explains 24\% of the
   variance in cooperation, above and beyond the DIAMONDS model. Throughout
   these studies, we develop and validate a multidimensional measure of
   subjective outcome interdependence that can be used in diverse
   situations and relationships-the Situational Interdependence Scale
   (SIS). We discuss how this model of interdependence can be used to
   better understand how people think about social situations encountered
   in close relationships, organizations, and society.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {549-573},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper investigates factors that determine users' behaviours during
   services co-creation, as well as those that influence their engagement
   in such efforts.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Study 1 relies on partial least squares structural equation modelling
   and between-subjects, scenario-based experiments with 633 participants
   to examine users' co-creation behaviours. Study 2 uses interactive
   research workshops with 38 design professionals to analyse the drivers
   and inhibitors of users' co-creation engagement and the likelihood of
   different user types to engage in it.
   Findings
   Dispositional and demographic factors can predict users' behaviours
   during services co-creation. A proposed framework details drivers and
   inhibitors of users' engagement in co-creation, and a typology predicts
   the likelihood of different users to engage in co-creation, based on
   their traits and demographics. This likelihood to co-create, according
   to traits, then can be predicted according to elemental, compound and
   situational traits.
   Practical implications
   Service providers and service designers can use these findings to design
   better co-creation activities for various users, build a conducive
   working environment and select suitable participants for co-creation
   activities.
   Originality/value
   The current study addresses the dearth of research pertaining to how to
   encourage users to co-create services and drive their engagement in such
   efforts.},

Title = {Mentalizing During Social Interaction: The Development and Validation of
   the Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Studies have shown that during social interaction a shared system
   underlies inferring one's own mental state, and the mental states of
   others - processes often referred to as mentalization. However, no
   validated assessment has been developed to measure second order
   mentalization (one's beliefs about how transparent one's thoughts are to
   others), or whether this capacity plays a significant role in social
   interaction. The current work presents a interactive mentalization
   theory, which divides these directional and second order aspects of
   mentalization, and investigates whether these constructs are measurable,
   stable, and meaningful in social interactions. We developed a 20-item,
   self-report interactive mentalization questionnaire (IMQ) in order to
   assess the different sub-components of mentalization: self-self,
   self-other, and other-self mentalization (Study 1). We then tested this
   scale on a large, online sample, and report convergent and discriminant
   validity in the form of correlations with other measures (Study 2), as
   well as correlations with social deception behaviors in real online
   interaction with Mturk studies (Study 3 and Study 4). These results
   validate the IMQ, and support the idea that these three factors can
   predict mentalization in social interaction.},

Abstract = {Psychometric examination of the Beck Depression Inventory-II has been
   adequate and varied for outpatient and nonclinical samples, but is still
   comparatively scant for inpatient psychiatric samples. In particular,
   important factor analytic questions have not been assessed on inpatient
   samples at all. Given that over time alone (regardless of symptom
   change) test scores on depression measures can spuriously drop, a
   convergent psychometric analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory-II was
   undertaken with a new measure of depression severity, the Grossman-Cole
   Depression Inventory. A sample of 101 psychiatric inpatients was
   administered both tests. Item and scale level psychometrics were
   reviewed for each measure. Results were highly consistent with previous
   findings, providing support for the use of the Beck Depression
   Inventory-II with inpatient samples. Moreover, the new inventory
   performed quite well, suggesting it has promise as another measure for
   self-reported depression symptom severity. The Beck Depression
   Inventory-II appears appropriately considered as a single-factor
   hierarchical measure of depression with the current inpatient sample.
   Moreover, the Grossman-Cole Depression Inventory is related enough to
   the Beck inventory to provide adequate similarity without being so
   similar the measures duplicate each other.},

Abstract = {The treatment of juvenile offenders remains a problem of broad interest

   yielded a two-factor model, with each having acceptable reliability.
   Additionally, based on the characteristics of each item, which were
   examined using the graded response model, 10 items were retained in the
   provisional scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis
   conducted in Study 2 (N = 866) confirmed the two-factor model and its
   generalizability to other age groups (i.e. 16/17 and 14/15). Convergent
   validity with social dominance orientation and right-wing
   authoritarianism, incremental validity with support for harsher

Abstract = {Previous research on corporate governance has extensively explored the
   motives of corporate fraud. However, this research has paid little
   attention to employees, the real executors of fraud, resulting in the
   psychological and behavioral decision-making process of employees who
   commit fraud in enterprises becoming a ``black box{''} that has not yet
   been opened. Based on the theory of planned behavior, our study
   integrates the existing research findings on driving factors of employee
   fraud and anti-fraud practical experience, extracts the key factors of
   employee fraud motive, and develops a multidimensional scale of employee
   fraud motive. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) generates three
   subscales, comprising 14 items, measuring attitude, subjective norm and
   perceived behavioral control of employee fraud motive. The confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) supports the reliability, discriminant validity
   and convergent validity of the new scale. The multiple regression
   results show that the score of employee fraud motive is positively
   correlated with the amount of employee fraud occurrence, indicating that
   the predictive validity of the scale holds. Overall, the scale developed

Number = {5},
Pages = {719-739},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Women are less competitive than men in most contexts studied. This
   difference has been linked to the gender gap in socio-economic outcomes.
   To examine whether this gender difference is linked to differential
   beliefs about competition, we developed a scale measuring lay beliefs
   about competition and tested whether these beliefs account for gender
   differences in competitive attitudes and behaviors. A mini meta-analysis
   (N = 2331) of responses to this scale shows that men attribute more
   positive outcomes to competition than women. In particular, men are more
   likely to believe that competition improves performance, builds
   character, and leads to creative problem-solving. In contrast, the
   gender differences are smaller, less robust, and inconsistent for the
   different negative outcomes attributed to competition, such as
   encouraging unethical behavior, hurting self-esteem, and damaging
   relationships. We also show in two studies that only positive lay
   beliefs about competition predict competitive attitudes and behaviors,
   and account for (some of) the gender difference in competitiveness. We
   discuss possible reasons that women and men hold different beliefs about
   competition and the implications of these differences for the optimal
   design of social and organizational structures.},

Abstract = {Individuals often influence others' relationships, for better or worse.
   We conceptualize social influence processes that impact others' social
   networks as brokering, and advance a multifaceted model that explains
   how brokering behaviors can create, terminate, reinforce, and modify
   others' network ties. To empirically study brokering. we introduce and
   validate the Brokering Orientations Scale (BOS), a multidimensional
   measure that captures individuals' behavioral tendencies to act as
   intermediaries, conciliators, and dividers. Six studies (N = 1.723)
   explored the psychometric properties of the BOS (Studies 1a-c) and
   investigated the effects of distinct forms of brokering on brokers'
   social capital (Studies 2-4). The intermediary, conciliatory and
   divisive brokering orientations related differently to extraversion,
   agreeableness, perspective-taking, moral identity, and Machiavellianism,
   among other individual differences. The effects of brokering on social
   capital varied as a function of the brokering orientation and the aspect
   of social capital. Intermediary behavior garnered status; conciliatory
   behavior promoted trust and prestige; and divisive behavior fueled
   brokers' perceived dominance. Overall, the current article elucidates
   the concept of brokering orientations, introduces a novel measure of

Abstract = {Persistence is often viewed as a behavioral event, whereby a person
   works through obstacles in the pursuit of a goal. This
   operationalization does not speak to persistence as an individual
   difference, but many researchers have observed people for which

   broadly. We suggest that several closely related constructs, such as
   grit and perseverance, may partially capture multiple dimensions of the
   overall construct of persistence. These dimensions are Persistence
   Despite Difficulties (PDD), Persistence Despite Fear (PDF), and
   Inappropriate Persistence (IP). In an initial study, we show that these
   three dimensions emerge in multiple measures for these closely related
   constructs, along with the construct of Goal Time Preference (GTP).
   Then, we create the Multidimensional Persistence Scale through a
   three-study process, showing that the scale has satisfactory
   psychometric properties and validity, and we support our
   three-dimensional conceptualization of persistence. Lastly, in two
   studies, we demonstrate that the three dimensions of persistence have

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {More than 100 years ago, the term conspicuous consumption was coined. In
   the economist tradition, emphasis was always on the demonstration of
   wealth, income, and status by material purchases. However, conspicuous
   consumption not only means the ostentation of wealth but also the
   demonstration of something symbolic that is more immaterial. There is an
   increasing importance of immaterial experiences over material things in
   the current cultural climate. This study investigates the role of
   conspicuous consumption for vacation decision-making as an example of an
   experiential purchase. The study found that communicating about
   vacations with others is important and increases by the ubiquitous use
   of social media. Two conspicuous consumption factors are found, namely
   those of (a) status and wealth and (b) identity demonstration. The first
   factor plays little or no role in holiday choice. The second is found to
   be of importance and is characterized by items such as having unique
   experiences, showing other people who you are, and visiting trendy
   locations. Thus, with a holiday one wants to show more of his or her
   personality and identity than of status and wealth. This fits into other
   empirical research in which it is shown that experiences make people
   more happy than material possessions.},

Abstract = {We developed and validated a scale to measure job crafting behavior in
   three separate studies conducted in The Netherlands (total N = 1181).
   Job crafting is defined as the self-initiated changes that employees
   make in their own job demands and job resources to attain and/or
   optimize their personal (work) goals. In Study land 2 the Dutch job
   crafting scale (JCS) was developed and tested for its factor structure,
   reliability, and convergent validity. The criterion validity of the JCS
   was examined in Study 3. The results indicated that there are four
   independent job crafting dimensions, namely increasing social job
   resources, increasing structural job resources, increasing challenging
   job demands, and decreasing hindering job demands. These dimensions
   could be reliably measured with 21 items. The JCS shows convergent
   validity when correlated with the active constructs proactive
   personality (+), personal initiative (+), and the inactive construct
   cynicism (-). In addition, results indicated that self-reports of job
   crafting correlated positively with colleague-ratings of work
   engagement, employability, and performance - thus supporting the
   criterion validity of the JCS. Finally, self-rated job crafting
   behaviors correlated positively with peer-rated job crafting behaviors.

   predictors, without overfitting the sample. Research goals in psychology
   may sometimes call for high dimensional regression. One example is
   criterion-keyed scale construction, where a scale with maximal
   predictive validity must be built from a large item pool. Using this as
   a working example, we first introduce a core principle of SLT methods:
   minimization of expected prediction error (EPE). Minimizing EPE is
   fundamentally different than maximizing the within-sample likelihood,
   and hinges on building a predictive model of sufficient complexity to
   predict the outcome well, without undue complexity leading to
   overfitting. We describe how such models are built and refined via
   cross-validation. We then illustrate how 3 common SLT
   algorithms-supervised principal components, regularization, and
   boosting-can be used to construct a criterion-keyed scale predicting
   all-cause mortality, using a large personality item pool within a
   population cohort. Each algorithm illustrates a different approach to
   minimizing EPE. Finally, we consider broader applications of SLT
   predictive algorithms, both as supportive analytic tools for
   conventional methods, and as primary analytic tools in discovery phase
   research. We conclude that despite their differences from the classic
   null-hypothesis testing approach-or perhaps because of them-SLT methods
   may hold value as a statistically rigorous approach to exploratory
   regression.},

   Scale Validation and Cultural Adaptation Study},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 31},
Abstract = {People differ in their responsiveness to aesthetic experiences. It is
   important to understand the role of culture in such individual
   differences, yet existing tools for assessing aesthetic responsiveness
   largely focus on North American and European cultures. We created a
   Farsi translated and culturally adapted version of the Aesthetic
   Responsiveness Assessment (AReA) and evaluated its psychometric
   properties. Construct validity and internal consistency were evaluated
   in a sample of 1,586 participants. Moreover, convergent and discriminant
   validity were investigated using the Behavioral Avoidance/Inhibition
   Scales (BIS-BAS), Big Five Inventory-2, Barcelona Music Reward
   Questionnaire (BMRQ), and the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale
   (TEPS). Further, the test-retest reliability of AReA was examined for
   the first time in a subsample of participants (n = 160) who answered the
   questionnaire again after 6 months. In addition to an acceptable
   structural validity (comparative fit index, CFI = .905), the Farsi
   version of AReA showed good internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha for
   the overall score was .848 and varied between .64 and .81 for subscales.
   Concerning convergent and discriminant validity, AReA subscales were
   positively correlated with subscales of TEPS, the Emotion Evocation
   subscale of BMRQ, Behavioral Avoidance, and Openness, and were unrelated
   to Behavioral Inhibition, Conscientiousness, and Negative Emotionality.
   Moreover, AReA subscales showed different patterns of correlations with
   other questionnaires. Finally, all subscales of AReA showed high
   test-retest reliability, ranging from .715 to .778. Our results confirm
   the validity of the Farsi version of AReA and provide a new measure of
   aesthetic responsiveness, useful in Farsi-speaking communities, which
   facilitates cross-cultural research in empirical aesthetics.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {The lockdown situation caused by COVID-19 has increased the use of
   social networks, which could, in turn, increase social networks
   addiction. This research consists of two integrated studies aimed at (1)
   developing and validating the Social Networks Motives Scale (SN-MotiveS)
   and (2) examining the relationships between the frequency of use of
   social networks and the motives for why individuals use social networks
   with social networks addiction, as well as the evolution of these
   variables over time before (through a retrospective assessment), during,
   and after lockdown. During lockdown, an online questionnaire was
   distributed to a sample of 482 participants (Study 1). After lockdown,
   114 participants from Study 1 completed a second online questionnaire,
   forming a longitudinal study (Study 2). Study 1 showed a robust fit for
   the multifactorial structure of the SN-MotiveS with four factors
   (socialization, escapism, prosocial behavior, and self-presentation),
   supporting the external validity of the scale, and the expected
   correlation patterns were found with social networks frequency of use,
   abuse, and addiction. Study 2 showed that all the motives increased
   during lockdown except for self-presentation, whereas after lockdown
   only prosocial behavior and employment (added in Study 2) decreased
   significantly. Moreover, the self-presentation and escapism motives
   acted as mediators in the relationship between social networks frequency
   of use and social networks addiction. This research provides a reliable
   instrument to measure the motives for using social networks both during
   a pandemic and in normal times. In addition, it highlights the
   importance of paying special attention to escapism motives for
   predicting social networks addiction in periods of lockdown.},

Abstract = {People vary in experiences of positive and negative emotions from
   consuming alcohol, but no validated measurement instrument exclusively
   devoted to assessing drinking emotions exists in the literature. The
   current research validated and evaluated the psychometric properties of
   an alcohol affect scale based on adjectives from the Positive and
   Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and tested the extent that emotions
   incurred from drinking were distinct from general trait-based emotions.
   Three studies tested independent samples of adult alcohol users. In
   Study 1 (N = 494), exploratory factor analyses of the Alcohol PANAS
   revealed that both the 20-item model and the 9-parcel model (represented
   by similar mood content) supported the 2-factor dimensionality of
   alcohol positive and negative affect. In Study 2 (N = 302), confirmatory
   factor analyses corroborated the measurement structure of alcohol
   positive and negative affect, and both constructs evidenced statistical
   independence from general positive and negative affect. In Study 3 (N =
   452), alcohol positive and negative affect exhibited discriminant,
   convergent, and criterion validity with established alcohol scales.
   Incremental validity tests demonstrated that alcohol positive and
   negative affect uniquely contributed (beyond general positive and
   negative affect) to alcohol expectancies, use, and problems. Findings
   support that alcohol emotions are conceptually distinct from trait
   emotions, and underscore the necessity of an assessment instrument
   tailored to the former to examine associations with alcohol beliefs and
   behaviors. The Alcohol PANAS confers theoretical and practical
   applications to understand the emotional consequences of drinking.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this research was to develop a conceptualization
   and measure of workplace coachability. Design/methodology/approach Using
   four independent samples of employed adults, we developed a short and
   long version of the Coachability Scale. We followed standard scale
   development practices, presenting evidence of the scales' factor
   structure, reliability and validity. Findings With the first two
   samples, we derived an initial three-dimensional version of the
   Coachability Scale and provided evidence of convergent validity. With
   Samples 3 and 4, we expanded the scale with additional dimensions
   related to coaching feedback processes and accumulated additional
   evidence of the scale's validity, and provided evidence of convergence
   between the two versions of the Coachability Scale. Research
   limitations/implications We encourage continued research on the
   Coachability Scale, as well as research on coachability in formal
   coaching relationships and with more diverse populations and cultures.
   It is also important to examine how coachability relates to specific
   coachee behaviors and outcomes. Although common method bias may be a
   limitation, we used temporally separated measurements to minimize method
   bias in Sample 4. Practical implications Knowledge about coachability
   can inform coaching practice decisions and help tailor the coaching
   engagement to better fit the coachee's needs. Social implications
   Measuring how individuals respond to coaching and coaching relationships
   has important implications for managerial behavior and the quality of
   work life. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to develop
   valid scales for assessing workplace coachability.},

Abstract = {This paper calls into question traditional methods of measuring the
   social desirability of items and their use in scale construction. First,
   we make explicit that the proper focus for desirability studies of items
   and traits are the rated desirabilities of the alternative item
   responses indicating different trait levels. Second, the results from
   our first study show that the relation between degree of endorsement of
   an item and its judged desirability level is often nonlinear and varies
   across items such that no general model of item desirability can be
   adopted that will accurately represent the relations across all items,
   traits, and trait levels. In addition, the nature of these relationships
   can vary depending on whether desirability is considered in a work or
   general context. Third, results from a second study indicate
   specifically that people when instructed to self-present in a maximally
   desirable manner will choose for some attributes a moderate level of
   endorsement (e.g., ``agree{''}) rather than a more extreme response
   option (e.g., ``strongly agree{''}). Subjects offer several different
   reasons for viewing the less extreme response options, which yield more
   moderate trait level scores, as more desirable. These reasons are linked
   to perceptions of the more extreme response option as being associated
   with negative behaviors and concerns about how others will view a more
   extreme response to the item. Both studies indicate that desirable
   responding to personality items is more complex than previously
   believed.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {There are many adaptive functions of music listening (AFML) that are
   relevant for understanding wellbeing. Functions relating to mood and
   emotion regulation dominate general measures of music listening
   functions. Eudaimonic functions of music listening (FML) have been
   identified, but no scale has been developed to measure these functions.
   The current study reports on the development of a new measure to assess
   eudaimonic music listening functions. Items were developed based on a
   prior qualitative study and a literature review focused on music
   listening and wellbeing. The factor structure was investigated by EFA
   and CFA in a large sample of participants (N= 637, 17-66 years,M=
   22.04,SD= 6.23, 326 males). Tests of dimensionality revealed a three
   factor scale with seven items. The scale and its subscales possess good
   internal consistency. The Eudaimonic FML scale measures Transcendence,
   Flow, and Peak Experience. Contrary to expectations eudaimonic FML did
   not relate to higher wellbeing (higher positive affect, lower negative
   affect, higher life satisfaction), rather results suggest that these FML
   are associated with greater emotional experience more generally. This
   brief scale will have applications in research focused on music
   listening benefits, music selection preferences, and experimental and
   developmental effects of music listening on psychological outcomes.},

   instruments currently available focuses on authenticity in the area of
   work and organizational psychology. A total sample of 646 participants
   was divided in two equal sized subsamples. Exploratory factor analysis
   supported the underlying tripartite construct of authenticity at work,
   resulting in the subscales authentic living, self-alienation, and
   accepting external influences. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed
   the tripartite construct and showed good psychometric properties of the
   state-focused measure of authenticity at work. Finally, correlation
   analysis showed that each subscale and the total score of authenticity
   was positively related to commonly used work outcomes such as job
   satisfaction, in-role performance, and work engagement. This study

Abstract = {Self-esteem stability describes fluctuations in the level of self-esteem

   decades, self-esteem stability has repeatedly been shown to be an

   measures of self-esteem stability are few and lacking in validity. In
   this paper, we present the Self-Esteem Stability Scale (SESS), a
   unidimensional and very brief scale to directly assess self-esteem
   stability. In four studies (total N = 826), we describe the development
   of the SESS and present evidence for its validity with respect to
   individual outcomes (life satisfaction, neuroticism, and vulnerable
   narcissism) and dyadic outcomes (relationship satisfaction in self- and
   partner ratings) through direct comparisons with existing measures. The
   new SESS proved to be a stronger predictor than the existing scales and
   had incremental validity over and above self-esteem level. The results
   also showed that all cross-sectional measures of self-esteem stability
   were only moderately associated with variability in self-esteem levels
   assessed longitudinally with multiple administrations of the Rosenberg
   Self-Esteem Scale. We discuss this validity issue, arguing that direct

Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 20},
Abstract = {Employees play a central role in organizational functioning and
   representation. HR managers thus strive to create an attractive employer
   image that stimulates employees' attachment and ambassadorship. However,
   presently, there is limited research about how employees perceive and
   react toward their organization's employer brand. More importantly, the
   studies available have focused on content attributes only (i.e.,
   instrumental and symbolic image dimensions). This has resulted in
   limited (content-based) understanding of the construct and failure to
   incorporate its branding-related aspects (process attributes) which
   represent the crux of employer branding theory. Thus, using the HRM
   system strength theory and employer branding literature, this article
   examines three process characteristics (i.e., employer brand
   distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus) vis-a-vis instrumental and
   symbolic content attributes to understand employee reactions (i.e.,
   employer attractiveness, organizational identification, and employee
   ambassadorship). Data were collected at two times through Prolific
   Academic with 254 UK and US employees. Results suggest that employer
   brand process attributes are valuable sources to enhance employees'
   identification with their organization. Moreover, distinctiveness and
   consistency seem especially instrumental in enhancing employees'
   attractiveness perceptions and display of positive ambassadorship. In
   addition, the process attributes explain significant incremental and

Abstract = {Polychronicity has traditionally been defined as a form of behavior
   wherein a person engages in two or more activities during the same block
   of time, while monochronicity occurs when a person engages in one
   activity at a time. These concepts have become increasingly relevant in
   discussions of `time personality', worktime in the home, and
   technological impacts on time. Other underlying dimensions of
   polychronicity also exist, such as preferences and feelings towards
   whether to combine activities or not. In order to reflect this more
   complex perspective, a validated, updated measure of a person's
   polychronic-monochronic overall tendency is needed. The present study is
   a re-inquiry and extension of the Polychronic Attitude Index (PAI),
   introduced in 1991. In the current research plan we propose, develop,
   and validate a general five-item comprehensive `reflective' single
   factor extended model. The general Polychronic-Monochronic Tendency
   Model is constructed using confirmatory factor analysis. The five-item
   summated scale from this model is named the Polychronic-Monochronic
   Tendency Scale (PMTS). A series of five separate studies were used to
   variously test for social desirability response bias, internal
   consistency, discriminant validity, and nornological validity. The PAI
   is also compared statistically to PMTS with the latter being clearly
   stronger. A discussion of the results and research implications are

Abstract = {This paper describes the development and validation of the Benefits and

   employees perceive the effects of cultural diversity in the workplace.
   By analyzing employees' perceptions, organizations may be able to
   communicate more effectively about diversity, and reduce potential
   diversity resistance by targeting those employees who feel most
   threatened by the process of diversification. First, a conceptual
   framework is established regarding possible positive and negative
   perceptions regarding cultural diversity in the workplace, based on both
   existing literature and qualitative data gathered in interviews. The
   final structure of the BTDS includes five subdimensions of benefits, and
   four subdimensions of threats. The internal structure, reliability and
   construct validity of the BTDS are established using quantitative data
   gathered in existing organizations. Our results also show that the
   respective dimensions of benefits and threats are mostly independent.
   This implies that individuals who perceive many benefits of diversity do
   not perceive less threats, or vice versa. This, in turn, suggests that
   individuals are not either pro or con diversity, as is often assumed in
   existing literature, but instead may possess a more nuanced view.},

Abstract = {Procrastination is a complicated phenomenon with many thoughts,

   In Study 1, we conducted qualitative research based on grounded theories
   and generated seven initial categories with 22 themes associated with
   the components in procrastination. In Study 2, we developed an
   instrument, the Multidimensional Procrastination Scale (MPS), and
   established a five-dimension structure for the MPS using explanatory
   factor analysis (EFA; N = 435) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; N

   validity for the MPS by building a nomological framework and predicting
   behavioral procrastination, respectively. The theoretical framework of
   procrastination included maladaptive (i.e., impulsive and unorganized,
   hesitation, lack of incentives, avoidance) and adaptive (i.e., arousal
   and rationalization) components. The MPS demonstrated acceptable
   reliability, factorial validity, construct validity, and predictive

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SELECTION AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One of the most prominent and widely used self-reporting scales for
   assessing organizational justice perceptions was developed by Colquitt
   (2001). This scale has been used internationally and has therefore been
   translated into several languages including Arabic. In a recent study,
   after conducting a careful review of organizational justice literature
   to ensure its relevance to Arabic culture, Alkhadher and Gadalreb (2016)
   developed a new Arabic measure of organizational justice (AMOJ)
   perceptions and found evidence of a four-factor scale structure. The
   purpose of this study is to compare the Arabic version of Colquitt's
   measure of organizational justice (AVCMOJ) with the AMOJ in terms of
   predictive power using various outcome measures used by Colquitt (2001).
   The two scales were administered to 781 Kuwaiti employees (47.6\% males)
   from the public sector. A multiple-sample confirmatory factor analysis
   supports the four-dimensional structure for both AVCMOJ and AMOJ
   measures. Cronbach's alpha obtained for subscales was found to range
   between 0.72 and 0.85. The predictive power of the three AMOJ dimensions
   (distributional, procedural, and informational) was found to be higher
   than that of the AVCMOJ. The results of the present study raise issues
   of scale development against the translation of well-developed scales.
   Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Title = {Understanding the ties between brand gender and brand engagement in
   online brand communities: the moderating role of consumers' biological
   sex},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {761-779},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine how brand gender (masculine/feminine
   brand personality {[}FBP] traits) stimulates brand engagement (cognitive
   processing, affection and activation) inside online brand communities
   (OBCs). The authors also explore the mediation of this effect through
   brand identification and brand personality appeal (BPA). The moderating
   role of consumers' biological sex is also investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model has been tested with
   the data collected from OBC members through the structural equation
   modelling technique. Bootstrapping is used for mediation analysis and
   multiple group analysis for testing the moderating effects. Findings
   Results show that masculine brand personality (MBP) influences brand
   engagement directly, as well as through brand identification and BPA.
   However, FBP elicits brand engagement only through the mediation of
   brand identification and BPA. Consumers' biological sex moderates the
   effect of FBP on brand engagement, but no moderation was traced for the
   effect of MBP on brand engagement. Research limitations/implications The
   context of the research poses a limitation on the broader replication of
   study findings. Other limitations include the absence of community-based
   variables and the focused use of gender centric brands in this study.
   This research will help researchers to understand the nuances in the
   underlying relationship between brand gender and brand engagement inside
   OBCs. Practical implications The managers can emphasize MBP but should
   not downplay the importance of FBP inside OBCs. To achieve brand
   engagement, the marketers should curate FBP in a way to affecting
   consumers' brand identification and brand appeal. To achieve consumer
   brand engagement, MBP can be targeted at both male and female consumers,
   whereas FBP holds more importance among female consumers. Therefore,
   classifying members as per their biological sex is recommended for
   better brand engagement from brand gender inside OBCs. Originality/value
   This study explores finer mechanisms in the relationship between brand
   gender and brand engagement inside OBCs by charting out the powerful
   mediating role played by brand identification and BPA. The moderating
   role of consumers' biological sex is an important dimension to these
   relationships, not explored hitherto.},

Title = {The five-dimensional curiosity scale: Capturing the bandwidth of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {130-149},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Since the origins of psychology, curiosity has occupied a pivotal
   position in the study of motivation, emotion, and cognition; and
   disciplines as far-ranging as biology, economics, robotics, and
   leadership. Theorists have disagreed about the basic tenets of
   curiosity; some researchers contend that the rewards arise when
   resolving ambiguity and uncertainty whereas others argue that being
   curious is an intrinsically pleasurable experience. Three studies were
   conducted to consolidate competing theories and isolated bodies of
   research. Using data from a community survey of 508 adults (Study 1),
   403 adults on MTurk (Study 2), and a nationally representative household
   survey of 3,000 adults (Study 3), we found evidence for five distinct
   factors: Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance,
   Social Curiosity, and Thrill Seeking - forming The Five-Dimensional
   Curiosity Scale (5DC). Each factor had substantive relations with a
   battery of personality, emotion, and well-being measures. Taking
   advantage of this multidimensional model, we found evidence for four
   distinct types of curious people in Study 3 referred to as The
   Fascinated (28\% of sample), Problem Solvers (28\%), Empathizers (25\%),
   and Avoiders (19\%). Subgroups differed in their passionate interests,
   areas of expertise, consumer behavior, and social media use; challenging
   an assumption that there is a homogenous population to be discriminated
   on a single dimension from incurious to very curious. With greater
   bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DC offers new opportunities for
   research on origins, consequences, life outcomes, and intervention
   strategies to enhance curiosity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The present study was designed to develop and describe the psychometric
   properties of the Self-satisfaction Scale (3S) among adults (including
   emerging adults) for the community sample. The research included three
   distinct studies. In Study 1, item pool generation and evaluation of
   content validity of the new scale by expert panel were carried out. In
   Study 2 (n = 532), the factor structure of 3S was examined with
   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and the internal consistency of the
   new scale was evaluated. In Study 3 (n = 503) Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis (CFA) was performed on the items determined by EFA in a
   different sample and the convergent validity of the new scale was
   assessed. EFA results displayed that 3S had seven factors accounting for
   73.87\% of the initial total variance and CFA results confirmed that
   these seven distinct but correlated factors were related to
   self-satisfaction on social, physical health, cognitive,
   emotional/psychological, physical appearance, sexual, and personality
   characteristics domains. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and
   McDonald's omega) of the 3S was .96 and all subscales had high internal
   consistency. To assess the convergent validity, 3S was administered
   together with Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS; Diener), Rosenberg Self
   Esteem Scale (RSES), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and
   Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The results revealed that 3S was
   positively correlated with the LSS, positive affect, and RSES while it
   was negatively correlated with negative affect and BDI. Test-retest
   reliability (N = 64) for total 3S was .89. Findings suggest that 3S is a
   psychometrically valid and reliable tool to assess self-satisfaction
   among adults and emerging adults.},

Title = {Agree to disagree: Examining the psychometrics of cybervetting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {435-450},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Purpose Due to the paucity of research on web-based job applicant
   screening (i.e. cybervetting), the purpose of the current study was to
   examine the psychometric properties of cybervetting, including an
   examination of the impact of adding structure to the rating process.
   Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed-factorial design, 122
   supervisors conducted cybervetting evaluations of applicant personality,
   cognitive ability, written communication skills, professionalism, and
   overall suitability. Cross-method agreement (i.e. the degree of
   similarity between cybervetting ratings and other assessment methods),
   as well as interrater reliability and agreement were examined, and
   unstructured versus structured cybervetting rating formats were
   compared. Findings Cybervetting assessments demonstrated high interrater
   reliability and interrater agreement, but only limited evidence of
   cross-method agreement was provided. In addition, adding structure to
   the cybervetting process did not enhance the psychometric properties of
   this assessment technique. Practical implications This study highlighted
   that whereas cybervetting raters demonstrated a high degree of consensus
   in cybervetting-based attributions, there may be concerns regarding
   assessment accuracy, as cybervetting-based ratings generally differed
   from applicant test scores and self-assessment ratings. Thus, employers
   should use caution when utilizing this pre-employment screening
   technique. Originality/value Whereas previous research has suggested
   that cybervetting ratings demonstrate convergence with other traditional
   assessments (albeit with relatively small effects), these correlational
   links do not provide information regarding cross-method agreement or
   method interchangeability. Thus, this study bridges a crucial gap in the
   literature by examining cross-method agreement for a variety of
   job-relevant constructs, as well as empirically testing the impact of
   adding structure to the cybervetting rating process.},

Title = {Speaking More Broadly: An Examination of the Nature, Antecedents, and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {99},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Scholarly interest in employee voice behavior has increased dramatically
   over the past 15 years. Although this research has produced valuable
   knowledge, it has focused almost exclusively on voice as a positively
   intended challenge to the status quo, even though some scholars have
   argued that it need not challenge the status quo or be well intentioned.
   Thus, in this paper, we create an expanded view of voice; one that
   extends beyond voice as a positively intended challenge to the status
   quo to include voice that supports how things are being done in
   organizations as well as voice that may not be well intentioned. We
   construct a framework based on this expanded view that identifies 4
   different types of voice behavior (supportive, constructive, defensive,
   and destructive). We then develop and validate survey measures for each
   of these. Evidence from 5 studies across 4 samples provides strong
   support for our new measures in that (a) a 4-factor confirmatory factor
   analysis model fit the data significantly better than 1-, 2-, or
   3-factor models; (b) the voice measures converged with and yet remained
   distinct from conceptually related comparison constructs; (c)
   personality predictors exhibited unique patterns of relationships with
   the different types of voice; (d) variations in actual voice behaviors
   had a direct causal impact on responses to the survey items; and (e)
   each type of voice significantly impacted important outcomes for voicing
   employees (e. g., likelihood of relying on a voicing employee's opinions
   and evaluations of a voicing employee's overall performance).
   Implications of our findings are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-28},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to introduce a concept of self-interested
   voice, or voluntarily expressed ideas, solutions, or concerns related to
   workplace issues that affect the voicer's personal interests. Three
   studies were conducted. In the scale development study, we developed and
   validated a new measure of self-interested voice with a sample of 36
   researchers for content validity and a sample of 362 employees for
   factorial and discriminant validity. In Study 1, we examined the
   antecedents and motivational pathways of self-interested voice. We
   proposed that perceived organizational politics (POP) can promote
   self-serving cognition, especially among those high in Machiavellian
   personality, and thus lead to self-interested voice. Our hypotheses were
   supported by results from time-lagged survey data from 262 employees and
   117 supervisors in China. In Study 2, we extended the model by including
   the outcomes of self-interested voice. Using another Chinese sample (282
   employees matched with 105 direct supervisors), we replicated the
   findings of Study 1 and additionally found that self-interested voice
   was negatively related to supervisors' liking and suggested salary
   increases of the employees but not task performance and promotability.
   The implications for employee voice research are discussed.
   Practitioner points
   Employees can send their voice concerning ideas, solutions, or concerns
   related to workplace issues that affect their personal interests.
   Perceived organizational politics (POP) is an important trigger of
   employee self-interested voice, especially among those high in
   Machiavellian personality. It is vital for managers to monitor the
   politicking climate in the workplace to reduce employees'
   self-interested voice at work.
   While employees are likely to engage in self-interested voice to protect
   their interests when perceiving organizational politics, such behaviour
   will lead to negative reactions from supervisors, such as lower
   supervisor liking and more hesitation in suggesting salary increases.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {98-113},
Abstract = {Purpose - Given the nature of entrepreneurship, a domain-specific
   self-efficacy scale should pertain to venture creation, be
   unidimensional, and be developed and validated using nascent
   entrepreneurs - persons for whom self-efficacy may be most important.
   Extant measures employed in entrepreneurship research do not meet all
   these criteria. The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a
   unidimensional entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) scale based on
   samples of nascent entrepreneurs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data from a sample of nascent
   entrepreneurs and items from PSED I were used to develop and assess the
   validity of a new ESE scale. To further establish scale validity, a
   comparison group from PSED I along with a sample of nascent
   entrepreneurs from PSED II were employed.
   Findings - A unidimensional three-item self-efficacy scale for assessing
   a person's belief that s/he can create a new business successfully is
   developed and validated using samples of nascent entrepreneurs and a
   control group.
   Research limitations/implications - The scale offers opportunity to
   enhance research-based assessment using a parsimonious, reliable, and
   valid unidimensional measure of ESE. The scale may enhance future
   research findings, as well as promoting reconsideration of past research
   findings, on many issues in the entrepreneurship literature.
   Originality/value - This research uses a sample of nascent entrepreneurs
   to provide a new three-item scale for assessment of ESE that is

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Interpersonal circumplex (IPC) inventories assess a range of
   dispositions but can condense and compare their findings within a
   circular model defined by two factors: agency and communion. Whereas
   other IPC inventories assess individuals, the current research
   introduces IPC inventories assessing the interpersonal culture
   (interaction and communication norms) characterizing an entire
   organization or team-namely, the Circumplex Culture Scan (CCS) and
   Circumplex Team Scan (CTS). Across an initial development sample (n =
   1676), online validation sample (CCS, n = 808; CTS, n = 832), and onsite
   validation sample (CCS, n = 516 respondents from 21 organizations; CTS,
   n = 347 respondents from 38 teams), the eight 8-item CCS/CTS octant
   scales demonstrated good internal consistencies, circumplex properties,
   reliable within-group agreement and between-group variance (thus
   justifying aggregation across an organization/team), and convergent,
   discriminant, and incremental validity in relation to other measures.
   According to their members, the organizations/teams with the most
   satisfied members and customers/clients were organizations/teams with
   considerably stronger communal (e.g., being open and respectful) than
   uncommunal (e.g., being rude and guarded) norms and somewhat stronger
   agentic (e.g., being eager and assertive) than unagentic (e.g., being
   cautious and quiet) norms. The CCS/CTS complements existing IPC and

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate how luxury brand attachment (LBA)
   and perceived envy may influence schadenfreude. In addition, the
   moderating influence of consumers' need for uniqueness (CNFU) and

   Data were collected from a consumer panel in Australia. A total of 365
   valid and useable responses were analysed through structural equation
   modelling in AMOS 26. Findings The results show that LBA has a
   significant impact on perceived envy. Consumers' perceived envy also
   results in schadenfreude. However, LBA did not have any significant
   impact on schadenfreude. The moderating influence of CNFU is partially
   supported. This research further confirms that consumers' public
   consumption has more relevance to visible social comparison and
   potential feelings of malicious envy towards others. Practical
   implications The research model may work as a strategic tool to
   identify, which group of consumers (e.g. high vs low attachment)
   displays stronger envy and schadenfreude. Brand managers can also
   explore the personality traits and psychological dynamics that influence
   the consumers to express emotional bonds and malicious joy within the

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The expansion in our understanding of the structure of differential
   cognitive abilities afforded by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model has
   brought with it the need to provide practitioners with efficient and
   effective methods for screening which abilities most critically require
   assessment. A Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Abilities could assist
   practitioners with this process. This article outlines the development
   and initial validation of the Self-Report Measure of Cognitive Abilities
   (SRMCA), a multi-item measure designed to indicate cognitive functioning
   in the CHC ability areas of Fluid reasoning (GO, Comprehension-knowledge
   (Gc), and Visual processing (Gv). Validity was initially investigated
   and supported using exploratory factor analysis, and then
   cross-validated on a second sample using structural equation modelling
   (SEM). Subsequently, SEM based multitrait-multimethod analysis of the
   second sample confirmed convergent validity for the Gc and Gv subscales,
   but not the Gf subscale. The extent of method variance influence on the
   SRMCA was found to be non-existent, a markedly different result to that
   found for the single-item self-estimates of cognitive abilities. Results
   thus indicate that the use of multiple and specific items allows for
   self-ratings of distinct cognitive ability areas to be independent of
   one another. Suggestions for future research aimed at extending the
   current study are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   developing a conceptualization of service experience based on a
   two-stage approach: initial item generation through qualitative
   research, initial purification of these findings through exploratory
   factor analysis, and validation through the use of confirmatory factor
   analysis and structural equation modeling.
   Findings - The paper conceptualizes and validates the concept of
   customer/service experience. In total, 19 items in four dimensions of
   the EXQ scale were identified: product experience, outcome focus,
   moments-of-truth and peace-of-mind. These dimensions reflect service
   experience perceptions. The findings support the conclusion that the
   service experience has a significant impact on customer satisfaction,
   loyalty and word-of-mouth intentions. The scale demonstrates good
   psychometric properties based on the variety of reliability and validity
   tests utilized and builds upon extant research.
   Practical implications - The research provides managers with the
   dimensions of service experience that influence purchase behavior and
   provides researchers with a sought-after conceptualization of service
   experience.
   Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first
   empirically founded conceptualization and measurement of the
   service/customer experience.},

Abstract = {With growing awareness about the self, consumers are increasingly
   becoming conscious of the role of fashion clothing in enhancing and
   communicating their self-image. They seek to portray their self-image
   through an outward display of fashion style that is congruent to their
   concept of self. Consumer's congruity however can be formed with both
   actual and ideal self. Recognizing this fact, the present study
   investigates the comparative impact of actual and ideal-fashion
   self-congruity on fashion consciousness and status consumption
   tendencies of millennials in India. The study also probes into the
   mediating role of fashion consciousness between the relationship of
   actual/ideal fashion self-congruity and status consumption. Using a
   sample of 751 millennials, the study confirms that ideal fashion
   self-congruity is a stronger predictor of fashion consciousness and
   status consumption in comparison to actual fashion self-congruity. In
   fact, actual fashion self-congruity did not have any significant impact
   on the two dependent variables. Additionally, the results of the study
   also point towards the mediating role of fashion consciousness between
   the relation of ideal fashion self-congruity and status consumption. The
   study points towards some notable implications for marketers of branded
   fashion wear by signifying the importance of the ideal-self in consumer
   decision-making process.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In three different studies, we challenge the traditional view that work
   and play are mutually exclusive phenomena. We introduce the concept of
   playful work design - the proactive cognitive-behavioral orientation
   that employees engage in to incorporate play into their work activities
   to promote fun and challenge. In Study 1, we utilized expert-ratings and
   iterative exploratory factor analyses to develop an instrument that
   measures (1) designing fun and (2) designing competition. Additionally,
   Study 1 evidences the divergent and convergent validity of the subscales
   as well as their distinctiveness. Specifically, playful work design was
   indicative of proactivity as well as play, and designing fun especially
   correlated with ludic traits (i.e. traits focused on deriving fun; e.g.
   humor), whereas designing competition particularly correlated with
   agonistic traits (i.e. traits focused on deriving challenge; e.g.
   competitiveness). Study 2 cross-validated the two-factor structure,
   further investigated the nomological net of playful work design, and
   revealed that playful work design is distinct from job crafting.
   Finally, Study 3 examined the predictive and incremental validity of the
   playful work design instrument with self- and colleague-ratings two
   weeks apart. Taken together, the results suggest that the instrument may
   advance our understanding of play initiated by employees during work.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine the differences in the process by
   which three types of self-congruity (actual, ideal and social) interact
   with the need for uniqueness (NFU) to influence brand loyalty via brand
   experience and brand attachment.
   Design/methodology/approach - An online survey with 428 members of an
   Australian consumer panel. The data are analyzed using the structural
   equation modeling (SEM).
   Findings - The results show that social self-congruity (SSC) has a
   direct effect on the brand attachment, but actual and ideal
   self-congruity (ASC and ISC) influence it only indirectly through brand
   experience. Moreover, the NFU strengthens the positive effect of ISC but
   weakens the effect of SSC on brand attachment.
   Research limitations/implications - This study uses publicly consumed
   brands and the NFU as the moderator. Future research may study privately
   consumer brands and use other moderators, such as regulatory focus
   (promotion vs prevention).
   Originality/value- This study extends current research on brand
   attachment by highlighting the positive influence of SSC on brand
   attachment. It also establishes the mediating role of brand experience
   and the moderating role of the NFU. These are new insights about the
   underlying process and the boundary conditions for the well-established

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this research is to examine how employees'
   experience of career dissatisfaction might curtail their organizational
   citizenship behavior, as well as how this detrimental effect might be
   mitigated by employees' access to valuable peer-, supervisor- and
   organizational-level resources. The frustrations stemming from a
   dissatisfactory career might be better contained in the presence of
   these resources, such that employees are less likely to respond to this

   sector. Findings Career dissatisfaction relates negatively to
   organizational citizenship behaviors, and this relationship is weaker at
   higher levels of peer goal congruence, supervisor communication
   efficiency and organization-level informational justice. Practical
   implications For organizations that cannot completely eradicate their
   employees' career-related disappointment, this study shows that they can
   still maintain a certain level of work-related voluntarism, to the
   extent that they develop and hone valuable resources internally.

Title = {Middle Response Scale Options are Inappropriate for Ideal Point Scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {463-478},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical rationale for the
   inappropriateness of middle response options on the response scales
   offered on ideal point scales, and to provide empirical support for this
   argument to assist ideal point scale development.
   The same ideal point scale was administered in three quasi-experimental
   groups varying only in the response scale offered: the three groups
   received either a four-, five-, or six-option response scale. An ideal
   point Item Response Theory model, the Generalized Graded Unfolding Model
   (GGUM), was fit to the response data, and model-data fit was compared
   across conditions.
   Responses from the four- and six-option conditions were fit well by the
   GGUM, but responses from the five-option condition were not fit well.
   Despite the scale being constructed to follow the tenets of ideal point
   responding, the GGUM was unable to provide a reasonable probabilistic
   account of responding when the response scale contained a middle option.
   The authors find support for the argument that an odd-numbered response
   scale does not match the principles of ideal point responding, and can
   actually result in misspecifying the underlying response process.
   Although a growing body of research has suggested that attitude and
   personality measurement is best conceptualized under the assumptions of
   ideal point responding, little practical advice has been given to
   researchers or practitioners regarding scale creation. This was the
   first study to theoretically and empirically assess the response scale
   on ideal point scales, and offer guidance for constructing ideal point
   scales.},

Title = {The Development and Validation of an Ideal Point Measure of Work
   Engagement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 28},
Abstract = {Work engagement has been an extremely popular area of research and
   practice over the past two decades. However, organizational scholars
   have yet to consider potentially more appropriate ways of modeling how
   individuals report their work engagement and, relatedly, of measuring
   it. This article seeks to (1) establish that individuals use an ideal
   point (vs. dominance) process to respond to work engagement items, (2)
   develop a construct valid work engagement scale with good psychometric
   properties using the ideal point framework, and (3) demonstrate the
   potential advantages that our ideal point scales can offer over existing
   dominance scales for work engagement research and practice. These goals
   were accomplished using a multi-phase approach. In Phase 1 we
   constructed a new ideal point work engagement scale (the IPWES), a short
   form (the IPWES-SF), and a dominance-style scale for comparisons (the
   DWES). In Phase 2, the psychometric performance of the IPWES was
   compared with that of the DWES and existing work engagement scales.
   Consistent with theory, the IPWES exhibited better fit, a more equal
   distribution of test information across the latent continuum, and
   different latent estimates towards the positive and negative ends of the
   continuum. Finally, Phase 3 established the construct validity of the
   IPWES and demonstrated its utility for uncovering curvilinear
   relationships with correlates of engagement over existing
   dominance-based scales. Notably, our findings were replicated with the
   IPWES-SF, supporting the use of the short version even in the study of
   complex relationships.},

Pages = {219-241},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how customers derive
   value ( functional, emotional, social and epistemic value) from the
   design aesthetics of mobile banking applications and then form intention
   to adopt mobile banking. Furthermore, this research investigates the
   moderating effect of happiness, which is predicted - and showed - to
   strengthen the effects of design aesthetics on value.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey using screenshots of mobile
   banking applications was administered to a sample of 281 bank customers.
   Data were analysed using SmartPLS.
   Findings - The results show that design aesthetics have a positive
   effect on functional, emotional, social and epistemic value. In turn,
   these value dimensions positively affect intention to adopt mobile
   banking. The findings also demonstrate that happiness moderates the
   effects of design aesthetics on these value dimensions.
   Practical implications - This work can be useful to designers of banking
   applications and other practitioners to improve their policies and
   strategies related to mobile applications.
   Originality/value - This research represents an initial attempt to
   examine how customers derive functional, emotional, social and epistemic
   value from design aesthetics in mobile banking. In addition, this
   research demonstrates that happiness moderates - and more specifically
   strengthens - the effects of design aesthetics on customer value. The

Abstract = {The process of development and testing of the Lang and Goulet Hardiness
   Scale (LGHS), a self-report instrument designed to measure hardiness in
   bereaved parents following the death of their fetus/infant, is
   presented. Hardiness is a personal resource, composed of 3
   interdependent components that are characterized by a sense of personal
   control over the outcome of life events and hardships such as the death
   of a fetus/infant, an active orientation toward meeting the challenges
   brought on by the loss, and a belief in the ability to make sense of
   one's own existence following such a tragedy. The concept of hardiness
   has been studied by various disciplines and in a multitude of settings
   to understand its ability to lessen potentially negative effects of life
   stress. However, it has never been studied within the context of
   parental bereavement. The LGHS was developed systematically, originating
   from a concept analysis. A panel of 15 experts was used to establish
   content validity. A pretest was conducted on 73 bereaved individuals to
   assess convergent and discriminant validity of the LGHS. Subsequently, a
   validation study on 220 bereaved parents who had experienced the death
   of their fetus/infant 2 months previously was conducted including a
   retest 6 months after the loss with 192 of the remaining participants.
   Analyses reveal that the LGHS is a valid and reliable instrument for
   measuring hardiness and that it is sensitive enough to detect changes in
   the construct over time.},

   risky scenarios for assessing the RP of Thai construction workers, with
   the goal of reducing workplace incidents. Method: The scale development
   process consists of four phases. Item development was also performed,
   followed by factor analysis. Reliability and validity assessments were
   finalized in the process. A survey of 500 construction workers in
   Thailand was conducted to investigate risky scenarios. Through the
   process, a total of 17 items remained in the final RP scale, and the
   reliability and validity of these items were confirmed. Results: The RP
   scale was affirmed to have four dimensions (probability, severity,
   worry, and unsafe). These dimensions of workers' RP were negatively
   correlated with the workers' risk-taking behaviors. This study further
   showed that participants with a high level of affective RP were more
   likely to have a high level of cognitive RP. Hence, those with a high
   level of RP tended to be involved in fewer risk-taking behaviors.
   Practical Applications: The final version of the scale was reliable and
   valid in determining the RP and risk-taking behaviors of construction
   workers in Thailand. (c) 2021 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

   it is considered necessary to develop a valid and reliable scale to
   measure for those entrepreneurial profiles. The relevant literature has
   been collected to this study. Furthermore, The methodology of the study
   adopts a scale of 30 items. The participants of the research constitute
   a total of 298 Turkish entrepreneurs. Exploratory factor analysis,
   Confirmatory factor analysis and Reliability analysis are used to
   examine the structure of the scale. Pearson Correlation Analysis and
   Hierarchical Linear Regression Analysis are used to test the hypotheses
   of the study. Through the results of exploratory factor analysis, a
   construct with 26 items and 3 factors, named as ``Commercial
   Entrepreneurs{''}, ``Social Entrepreneurs{''} and ``Strategic

   It is revealed that the Commercial Entrepreneurship profile is not
   predicted by intolerance to uncertainty. However, it has been determined
   that the profile of Social Entrepreneurship and Strategic
   Entrepreneurship is predicted by both motivational persistence and
   intolerance to uncertainty. Besides, it has been determined that most of

Abstract = {Research exploring nonbelievers' reasons for not believing in the

   valuable, but may not capture the lived experiences of nonbelievers. The
   current two studies quantitatively examined nonbelievers' self-reported
   reasons for nonbelief through developing the Reasons of Atheists and
   Agnostics for Nonbelief in God's Existence Scale (RANGES). We developed
   an initial pool of 64 items using prior published research, revised by a
   panel of experts including researchers and thought leaders in nonbelief
   communities. Both studies included participants from Amazon's Mechanical
   Turk (Study 1 \& 2 Ns = 520 \& 369), all of whom reported not believing
   in god(s). In Study 1, our exploratory factor analysis suggested nine
   factors across 35 items. In Study 2, we confirmed the nine-factor
   structure using 38 items (35 from Study 1 plus three new items for
   better coverage of factors with few items) with adequate fit. Across
   both studies, the RANGES subscales showed good reliability, convergent
   validity (e.g., positive correlations with previous lists of reasons for
   religious doubt), predictive validity (e.g., positive and negative
   feelings toward God and religion), and discriminant validity (e.g.,
   subscales were not unexpectedly associated with other measures). Our
   1-year follow-up with a subset of Study 2 participants (N = 132) found
   different levels of stability among the RANGES subscales. This measure
   can promote further understanding the motivations, identities, and
   experiences of nonbelievers across cultures.},

Title = {Centers of value and the quest for meaning in faith development: A
   measurement approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {James Fowler's model of faith development conceptualized ``faith{''} as
   the quest for and maintenance of meaning oriented around centers of
   value which may or may not be religious or spiritual in nature. Although
   this model foreshadowed later work in meaning in life, substantial
   bodies of literature have developed in each area, almost entirely
   independently of the other. Integration has been hindered by measurement
   difficulties in faith development work. Fowler's stages of faith
   development and their reformulation as Streib's religious styles are
   usually measured through either a lengthy Faith Development Interview or
   short measures that do not assess the breadth of domains covered in the
   interview. These short measures are in many cases oriented around
   religious faith and impossible for a non-believer to answer. Embedded
   within the original model and the interview are aspects of faith
   development including perspective taking, social horizon, morality,
   locus of authority, form of world coherence, and symbolic function. A
   new Centers of Value and Quest for Meaning Scale is proposed to assess
   the aspects, allow non-believers to respond, tap centers of value that
   are not religious, and eventually address the theoretical assumption of

Title = {Internal Structure and Criterion Relationships for Long and Brief
   Versions of the Intratextual Fundamentalism Scale (IFS) Among Israeli

Abstract = {The Intratextual Fundamentalism Scale (IFS; Williamson \& Hood, 2005)
   was designed to measure religious fundamentalism. Published analyses of
   the IFS-12 and various short forms have revealed potential issues with
   its psychometric fitness. For the present paper, we used bifactor
   confirmatory factor analysis, dimensionality measures (e.g., explained
   common variance), and model-based reliability estimates (e.g., omega
   hierarchical) to provide a more detailed examination of the
   dimensionality of the IFS-12 and the reliability of its raw total score
   among 432 Israeli Jews. Results indicated that the instrument is
   unidimensional enough to permit the use of a unidimensional solution
   when modeling the instrument. The IFS-12's raw total score was also
   found to predominantly reflect a single general Intratextual
   Fundamentalism factor, despite the presence of minor multidimensionality
   across items, which provides support for the reliability of this score.
   This conclusion was further supported by the results from structural
   regression-parameter bias tests: the decision to model the IFS-12 as a
   unidimensional instrument rather than a bifactor instrument did not
   alter the strength of the association between the general latent
   Intratextual Fundamentalism factor or any of the latent Big-5
   personality trait factors. Last, because the IFS-12 demonstrated poor
   global fit when modeled as a unidimensional instrument, we used
   individual explained common variance (IECV) coefficients to develop a
   short form: the IFS-6. Reliability evidence and internal unidimensional
   structure and content-oriented and concurrent evidence of validity are
   presented for the IFS-6 total score. The importance of follow-up
   research on the generalizability of these IFS-12, IFS-6, and IFS-5
   results across populations is discussed.},

Title = {Psychometric Characteristics of a New Scale for Measuring Self-efficacy
   in the Regulation of Gambling Behavior},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Since its introduction in 1977, self-efficacy has proven to be a
   fundamental predictor of positive adjustment and achievement in many
   domains. In problem gambling studies, self-efficacy has been defined
   mainly as an individual's ability to avoid gambling in risky situations.
   The interest in this construct developed mainly with regard to treatment
   approaches, where abstinence from gambling is required. Very little is
   known, however, regarding self-efficacy as a protective factor for
   problem gambling. This study aims to fill this gap, proposing a new
   self-efficacy scale which measures not only the ability to restrain
   oneself from gambling but also the ability to self-regulate one's
   gambling behavior. Two studies were conducted in which the data from two
   Italian prevalence surveys on problem gambling were considered. A total
   of about 6,000 participants were involved. In the first study, the
   psychometric characteristics of this new self-efficacy scale were
   investigated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The
   results indicated the presence of two different factors: self-efficacy
   in self-regulating gambling behavior and self-efficacy in avoiding risky
   gambling behavior. The second study confirmed the replicability of the
   two-factor solution and displayed high correlations among these two
   self-efficacy dimensions and different measures of gambling activities
   as well as other psychological variables related to gambling (gambling
   beliefs, gambling motivation, risk propensity, and impulsiveness). The
   results of logistic regression analyses showed the particular importance
   of self-regulating gaming behavior in explaining problem gambling as
   measured by Problem Gambling Severity Index and South Oaks Gambling
   Screen, thus proving the role of self-efficacy as a pivotal protective
   factor for problem gambling.},

Title = {Re-conceptualising the reckless driving behaviour of young drivers},
Journal = {ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {245-257},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reckless driving is a major contributing factor to road morbidity and
   mortality. While further research into the nature and impact of reckless
   driving, particularly among young people, is urgently needed, the
   measurement of reckless driving behaviour also requires increased
   attention. Three major shortcomings apparent in established measures of
   driver behaviour are that they do not target the full range of reckless
   driving behaviours, they measure characteristics other than driving
   behaviours, and/or they fail to categorise and label reckless driver
   behaviour based on characteristics of the behaviours themselves. To
   combat these shortcomings, this paper reports the development and
   preliminary validation of a new measure of reckless driving behaviour
   for young drivers. Exploratory factor analysis of self-reported driving
   data revealed four, conceptually distinct categories of reckless driving
   behaviour: those that increase crash-risk due to (a) distractions or
   deficits in perception, attention or reaction time (labelled
   ``distracted{''}), (b) driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol
   (labelled ``substance-use{''}), (c) placing the vehicle in an unsafe
   environment beyond its design expectations (labelled ``extreme{''}), and
   (d) speed and positioning of the vehicle relative to other vehicles and
   objects (labelled ``positioning{''}). Confirmatory factor analysis of
   data collected from a separate, community sample confirmed this
   four-factor structure. Multiple regression analyses found differences in
   the demographic and psychological variables related to these four
   factors, suggesting that interventions in one reckless driving domain
   may not be helpful in others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Assessing attitudes about hate: Further validation of the hate crime
   beliefs scale},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 13},
Abstract = {The Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS) is an assessment of attitudes about
   hate crime laws, offenders, and victims. The original HCBS includes four
   subscales (negative beliefs, offender punishment, deterrence, and victim
   harm), while a shortened and modified version from the United Kingdom
   (UK; HCBS-UK) consists of three subscales (denial, sentencing, and
   compassion). We conducted a psychometric test of the HCBS in order to
   identify a best fitting structure with possible item reduction. A total
   of 463 participants completed the original HCBS, measures of social
   dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and
   demographic questions. Factor analyses revealed good fit of the data for
   a Hate Crime Beliefs Scale-Short Form (HCBS-SF), largely modeled after
   the HCBS-UK. The three subscales were: denial (i.e., downplaying hate
   crime severity and low support for hate crime laws), sentencing (i.e.,
   support for more punitive offender punishment), and compassion (i.e.,
   understanding and concern for victims). All subscales possessed
   acceptable internal consistency. The denial subscale was positively
   associated with RWA subscale and SDO scores. The sentencing and
   compassion subscales were significantly negatively correlated with SDO
   and RWA subscale scores. Republicans held the least supportive views of
   hate crime laws, concern for victims, and punishment of offenders. Data
   underscore the importance of evaluating hate crime beliefs in public
   opinion and other contexts. The HCBS-SF better captures hate crime
   related attitudes than the previously developed longer version of the
   HCBS.},

Title = {The Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST): A psychometrically

Journal = {BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 29},
Abstract = {Interest in the psychology of misinformation has exploded in recent
   years. Despite ample research, to date there is no validated framework
   to measure misinformation susceptibility. Therefore, we introduce
   Verificationdone, a nuanced interpretation schema and assessment tool
   that simultaneously considers Veracity discernment, and its distinct,
   measurable abilities (real/fake news detection), and biases
   (distrust/naivite-negative/positive judgment bias). We then conduct
   three studies with seven independent samples (N-total = 8504) to show
   how to develop, validate, and apply the Misinformation Susceptibility
   Test (MIST). In Study 1 (N = 409) we use a neural network language model
   to generate items, and use three psychometric methods-factor analysis,
   item response theory, and exploratory graph analysis-to create the
   MIST-20 (20 items; completion time < 2 minutes), the MIST-16 (16 items;
   < 2 minutes), and the MIST-8 (8 items; < 1 minute). In Study 2 (N =
   7674) we confirm the internal and predictive validity of the MIST in
   five national quota samples (US, UK), across 2 years, from three
   different sampling platforms-Respondi, CloudResearch, and Prolific. We
   also explore the MIST's nomological net and generate age-, region-, and
   country-specific norm tables. In Study 3 (N = 421) we demonstrate how
   the MIST-in conjunction with Verificationdone-can provide novel insights
   on existing psychological interventions, thereby advancing theory
   development. Finally, we outline the versatile implementations of the
   MIST as a screening tool, covariate, and intervention evaluation
   framework. As all methods are transparently reported and detailed, this
   work will allow other researchers to create similar scales or adapt them
   for any population of interest.},

Title = {Seeing Your Life Story as a Hero's Journey Increases Meaning in Life},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 27},
Abstract = {Meaning in life is tied to the stories people tell about their lives. We
   explore whether one timeless story-the Hero's Journey-might make
   people's lives feel more meaningful. This enduring story appears across
   history and cultures and provides a template for ancient myths (e.g.,
   Beowulf) and blockbuster books and movies (e.g., Harry Potter). Eight
   studies reveal that the Hero's Journey predicts and can causally
   increase people's experience of meaning in life. We first distill the
   Hero's Journey into seven key elements-protagonist, shift, quest,
   allies, challenge, transformation, legacy-and then develop a new measure
   that assesses the perceived presence of the Hero's Journey narrative in
   people's life stories: the Hero's Journey Scale. Using this scale, we
   find a positive relationship between the Hero's Journey and meaning in
   life with both online participants (Studies 1-2) and older adults in a
   community sample (Study 3). We then develop a restorying intervention
   that leads people to see the events of their life as a Hero's Journey
   (Study 4). This intervention causally increases meaning in life (Study
   5) by prompting people to reflect on important elements of their lives
   and connecting them into a coherent and compelling narrative (Study 6).
   This Hero's Journey restorying intervention also increases the extent to
   which people perceive meaning in an ambiguous grammar task (Study 7) and
   increases their resilience to life's challenges (Study 8). These results
   provide initial evidence that enduring cultural narratives like the
   Hero's Journey both reflect meaningful lives and can help to create
   them.},

Title = {Managing Validity Versus Reliability Trade-Offs in Scale-Building
   Decisions},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-270},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Scale builders strive to maximize dual priorities: validity and
   reliability. While the literature is full of tips for increasing one,
   the other, or both simultaneously, how to navigate tensions between them
   is less clear. Confusion shrouds the nature, prevalence, and practical
   implications of trade-offs between validity and reliability-formerly
   called paradoxes. This confusion results in most trade-offs being
   resolved de facto at validity's expense despite validity being de jure
   the higher priority. Decades-long battles against clear measurement
   malpractice persist because unspecified trade-offs render scale-building
   decisions favoring validity perennially unattractive to scale builders.
   In light of this confusion, the goal of this article is to make plain
   that the source of validity versus reliability trade-offs is systematic
   error that contributes to item communality. Moreover, straightforward,
   nontrivial trade-offs pervade the scale-building process. This article
   highlights common trade-offs in 6 contexts: item content, item
   construction, item difficulty, item scoring, item order, and item
   analysis. I end with 5 recommendations for managing trade-offs and out 7
   ``dirty tricks{''} often used to exploit them when nobody's looking. In
   short, reviewers should require scale builders to declare how validity
   and reliability will be prioritized and penalize those who resolve
   trade-offs in goal-inconsistent ways.
   Translational Abstract
   When psychologists build surveys, they try to maximize validity and
   reliability. Yet sometimes these goals are in tension such that
   improving one means sacrificing the other-a trade-off. This article
   discusses why and when such trade-offs occur so that scale builders can
   better manage them and consumers of scale-based research can increase
   demand for better scales.},

Title = {When does ``liking{''} a charity lead to donation behaviour? Exploring
   conspicuous donation behaviour on social media platforms},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {51},
Number = {11-12},
Pages = {2002-2029},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to investigate the relationship between young
   people's Conspicuous Donation Behaviour (CDB) on social media platforms
   and their offline donation behaviour, specifically intentions to donate
   and volunteer time. It also explores materialism, self-esteem and
   self-monitoring as CDB trait antecedents, as a form of conspicuous
   consumption on social media. Finally, it considers the influence of
   altruism on these relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted of regular Facebook
   users mentioning a charity brand on Facebook in the past year. Data from
   234 participants were analysed and hypotheses tested using structural
   equation modeling.
   Findings - Results confirm two forms of CDB - self and other-oriented.
   Materialistic consumers are more likely to engage in both forms of CDB
   on Facebook. High self-esteem increases self-oriented CDB; high
   self-monitoring increases other-oriented CDB. Self-oriented CDB is
   positively associated with donation intentions, but other-oriented CDB
   is negatively associated. Findings reveal how altruism moderates this
   model.
   Research limitations/implications - Findings show how personality traits
   influence CDB and reveal the relationship between CDB, as virtual
   conspicuous consumption on social media platforms, and donation
   behaviour.
   Practical implications - The study provides implications for managers
   about enhancing charitable donations through social media.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to explore donation
   behaviour as a form of conspicuous consumption on social media, where
   virtual conspicuous consumption (i) does not require any offline
   consumption and (ii) may achieve the desired recognition, without any
   charitable act. It provides new insights into CDB, its antecedents and
   influence on donation behaviour.},

Journal = {LEADERSHIP \& ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {158-180},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the question of what
   motivates leaders to engage in effective leadership behaviours by
   integrating transformational leadership theory and self-determination
   theory. The authors propose that the type of enacted leadership
   behaviour is related to level of self-determined motivation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study presents validity evidence for
   an 18-item scale of motivation for transformational leadership based on
   Gagne and Degi's (2005) six levels of internalization. A total of 310
   employees (mean age = 39, 64.5 per cent female, 46 per cent formal
   leaders) completed the scale, other measures of leadership, and job
   satisfaction.
   Findings Results supported the theorized six-factor structure of the
   scale and provided evidence for incremental validity in the prediction
   of job satisfaction and transformational leadership above and beyond
   another measure of motivation to lead.
   Research limitations/implications - The lack of mnotivation and the
   presence of autonomously controlled extrinsic motivation are predictive
   of effective leadership behaviour, a key finding with implications for
   leadership selection, The study was limited by the use of self-report
   data, Future studies should examine additional predictors and outcomes
   of the construct (e.g. subordinate attitudes or performance and leader
   personality), and whether it is stable over time.
   Originality/value Leaders' - motivation for role effectiveness is an
   unexplored area of research. This study suggests that type of motivation
   can be important for effective leadership and provides a validated scale
   for use in future leadership research and selection.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {152},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-122},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Engaging in unethical consumption behaviors is an acute societal problem
   that can have severe consequences for adolescents, and businesses in
   particular have been accused of making such consumption particularly
   appealing and accessible. However, the causes of unethical behaviors are
   not well understood and research on the causes has been mixed. In this
   research, we investigate the effects of coping strategies for loneliness
   on adolescents' adoption of unethical behaviors, a topic that business
   ethics research has not explored. In a large-scale study (n=409) of
   adolescents (ages 13-17), we show that whether loneliness leads to the
   adoption of unethical behaviors depends on the strategies adolescents
   use to cope with their loneliness: active coping strategies are
   associated with fewer unethical behaviors, whereas passive coping
   strategies are associated with more unethical behaviors. In addition, we
   show that active and passive coping strategies can be executed through
   consumption practices. We show that the relation between active coping
   and fewer unethical behaviors is mediated by sharing of possessions,
   whereas the relation between passive coping strategies and more
   unethical behaviors is mediated by product acquisition. Finally, we also
   show that these mediated relations differ as a function of age cohort
   (grade level). The indirect effect of active coping on fewer unethical
   behaviors via sharing holds only for middle school adolescents, whereas
   the indirect effect of passive coping on more unethical behaviors via
   product acquisition holds only for high school adolescents. We shed new
   light on both the bright and dark sides of materialism and unethical
   behaviors and provide practical implications for research on loneliness,
   business ethics, and unethical behaviors.},

Title = {The Wisdom Acquired During Emergencies Scale - Development and Validity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown restrictions had
   repercussions on health status, psychological states of mind, and
   emotion regulation. Attitudes towards these restrictions, beliefs,
   emotions and behaviours could be wise, as in the acceptance of, and
   adaptation to, these constraints. On the other hand, they could be
   unwise, as in the rejection of rules and limitations, denial of the
   consequences, irrational beliefs, self-accusation, rage and general
   intolerance. This study aims to introduce the development and validation
   of the 25-item Wisdom Acquired During Emergencies Scale (WADES). It is a
   measure to assess the wisdom and self-regulation that are needed to cope
   with unexpected and unpredictable emergency situations. On the basis of
   a preliminary study (N-1=212 Italian adults), a multiple-choice scale of
   52 items was developed. In the reliability study (N-2=1777), items were
   scaled, analysed according to the optimal score technique and selected
   to provide a final and reliable version (Cronbach's alpha=0.83). The
   validity study (N-3=1,345, N-4=1,445, N-5= 878) provided correlations
   with established scales measuring, for example, traditional wisdom,
   emotion regulation, empathy, post-traumatic growth, collectivism,
   conscientiousness and satisfaction with life. The results confirmed that
   high scores on the WADES are associated with the ability to regulate
   emotions, control impulses and develop goals in emotional situations, to
   tolerate current difficulties, while developing new attitudes, values
   and behaviours, entailing changes in self-perception and relationships.
   It was thus confirmed that high WADES scores indicate a higher degree of
   acquired wisdom.},

Abstract = {Zuckerman's sensation seeking scales (Form V, 40 items) which were

   European Psychiatry,, 7, 225-234] were tried in a Chinese speaking area.
   Three hundred and twenty-two healthy subjects (204 women and 118 men)
   with a wide range of occupations attended this study and were divided
   into five age ranges. The principal component analysis detected 14
   factors (components) with eigenvalues larger than one, the first 4 of
   which accounted for 32.1\% of the variance. From the fifth factor on,
   none accounted for more than 3.5\% of the variance. Therefore, we chose
   the four-factor solution analysis. Most items loaded well on target
   factors except one on Thrill and Adventure Seeking and another on
   Experience Seeking. Total and subscale scores were lower than those
   reported in Western countries. Thrill and Adventure seeking declined
   with age. Men scored significantly higher in Disinhibition and Thrill
   and Adventure Seeking subscales in any age ranges. Higher Disinhibition
   seekers were between 30-39 years of age in men, but similarly
   distributed between 15-49 years of age in women. There were few gender
   differences in Experience Seeking and Boredom Susceptibility. This study
   demonstrates the validity of the sensation seeking scales in the Chinese
   culture, and confirms that gender is affected mainly on the
   Disinhibition and Thrill and Adventure Seeking subscales. (C) 1999

Title = {Flourishing in the now: Initial validation of a present-eudaimonic time

Journal = {TIME \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Introduction A positive focus on the present, the only time zone which
   we experience directly and permanently, is at least as relevant as
   perspectives on the past and future in a balanced time perspective and
   its relation to wellbeing. Yet, few instruments examining a positive
   present time perspective exist. Two present-directed concepts,
   mindfulness and flow, that are intrinsically linked to mental wellbeing
   were analyzed and used to formulate a present-eudaimonic scale that
   complements the past and future scales of the balanced time perspective
   scale. The present study addresses the psychometric properties of the
   present-eudaimonic scale and the modified balanced time perspective
   scale.
   Method 131 participants filled out the present-eudaimonic scale, the
   balanced time perspective scale, the Zimbardo time perspective
   inventory, the five facet mindfulness questionnaire - short form, the
   Swedish flow proneness questionnaire and the mental health continuum -
   short form. Balanced time perspective was operationalized using the
   deviation from a balanced time perspective coefficient.
   Results The present-eudaimonic scale showed good psychometric properties
   including internal consistency, factor structure, and convergent
   validity. The present-eudaimonic scale explained an additional eleven
   percent of variance in mental health beyond the other time perspective
   scales. Balanced time perspective as measured with the modified balanced
   time perspective scale correlated significantly stronger with mental
   health than balanced time perspective measured with the Zimbardo time
   perspective inventory.
   Conclusions The present-eudaimonic scale fills a gap in the assessment
   of time perspective and the modified balanced time perspective scale is
   a promising way to study balanced time perspective.},

Abstract = {Resume fraud is pervasive and has detrimental consequences, but
   researchers lack a way to study it. We develop and validate a measure
   for empirically investigating resume misrepresentations purposely
   designed to mislead recruiters. In study 1, an initial set of items
   designed to measure three theorized resume fraud dimensions
   (fabrication, embellishment, omission) are rated for content validity.
   In study 2, job seekers complete the measure and its factor structure is
   evaluated. In study 3, another sample of job seekers is surveyed to
   verify the measure's factor structure and to provide evidence regarding
   construct validity. In study 4, working adults who recently conducted a
   job search are surveyed to determine which individuals are more likely
   to commit resume fraud and whether resume fraud relates to critical work
   behaviors. We confirm the three-factor structure of our measure and
   offer evidence of construct validity by showing that socially desirable
   responding, Machiavellianism, moral identity, conscientiousness,
   emotional stability, and agreeableness are related to resume fraud.
   Additionally, we find that resume fraud predicts reduced job performance
   and increased workplace deviance beyond deceptive interviewing behavior.
   Resume fraud is rarely studied despite the negative impact it can have
   on job-related outcomes. Researchers can use this measure to explore
   further the antecedents and outcomes of resume fraud and to advise
   recruiters on how to minimize it. We develop a measure focusing on
   intentional resume misrepresentations designed to deceive recruiters.
   This is one of the first studies to examine the antecedents and outcomes
   of resume fraud.},

Title = {AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL OF CONSUMER BRAND ENGAGEMENT IN SOCIAL MEDIA},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE MARKETING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research was to propose an integrative
   model of consumer brand engagement in social media, with its antecedents
   and consequents, analyzing how engagement, together with positive online
   word of mouth, affect the purchase intention of the consumers in these
   environments.
   Method: A survey research with social media users has been developed.
   For the execution of the validation tests of the measurement models and
   the proposed structural model, Smart PLS-SEM 3.0 software was used.
   Originality/Relevance: The research focused on the most recurring
   motivations in the literature on consumer brand engagement in social
   media - self-expression, socializing and obtaining information , as well
   as examining the role of positive online word of mouth, as a result and
   an collaborator of consumer brand engagement for the purchase intention
   of consumers in those environments.
   Results: The proposed theoretical hypotheses were confirmed that the
   motivations personal expression, socialization and obtaining information
   positively impact on consumer brand engagement. Besides, it was found
   that consumer brand engagement influence the positive online word of
   mouth and purchase intention. In addition, the results indicate that
   consumer brand engagement and positive online word of mouth may exert a
   mediating effect on the relationship between motivations and purchase
   intention.
   Theoretical/methodological contributions: This work contributes to the
   theoretical development of consumer brand engagement in social media by
   empirically testing an integrative model that provides a better
   understanding of its process.
   Managerial/social contributions: Managerially, the survey provides
   guidance for building strategies that lead to increased consumer brand
   engagement in social media, as well as online recommendation and brand
   purchase intent. Socially, the study highlights the new forms of
   relationship of individuals with the brand, due to the need to socialize
   with their peers, express their personality and obtain information
   through social media.},

Title = {Development and preliminary validation of a scale of driving moral
   disengagement as a tool in the exploration of driving aggression},

Abstract = {Aggressive driving has been found to result in road collisions which are
   a major cause of injury, fatality and financial cost in motorised
   countries. Qualitative and survey based studies suggest that drivers use
   justifications or explanations of their aggressive driving that bear
   strong resemblance to Bandura's mechanisfns of moral disengagement. The
   aim of the current study was to explore the applicability of moral
   disengagement to the driving context using a purpose-adapted scale, the
   Driving Moral Disengagement Scale. A convenience sample of general
   drivers (N = 294) responded to an on-line survey comprised of measures
   of trait anger, driving anger (DAX revised), moral disengagement and
   driying moral disengagement. Factor analysis allowed for reduction of
   the new scale from 23 items to 13 items, and this shortened Driving
   Moral Disengagement Scale (DMDS) had good internal reliability
   (Cronbach's alpha.83). Scree plot criteria indicated a one factor
   solution accounting for 34.34\% of the variance. Bivariate correlations
   on the shortened DMDS revealed significant and positive relationships
   with measures of driving aggression, moral disengagement, trait anger
   and driving anger, r =.28-.55. Moreover the strength of the association
   between driving aggression and moral disengagement was greater than that
   with driving anger. Hierarchical regression revealed driving moral
   disengagement as the strongest significant predictor of driving
   aggression, accounting for 18\% of the unique variation in the DV, and
   suggesting this may be a more useful predictor than driving anger. In
   addition, significant differences between participants' mean scores for
   moral disengagement in everyday situations and their driving moral
   disengagement scores support the interpretation that drivers may behave
   differently from their `usual' selves when driving, and that the driving
   context may encourage both greater moral disengagement and greater
   tendency towards aggressive responses. Chi square analysis indicated
   that those who scored high on driving moral disengagement were
   significantly more likely to report aggressive responses to driving
   situations than those with low driving moral disengagement scores (with
   a large effect size, (p =.42). This suggests that the DMDS may be useful
   for future driving aggression research. Implications for intervention
   are that aiming to alert drivers to their usual self-censure mechanisms
   or to prevent the tendency to moral disengagement while driving may be
   effective in reducing driving aggression and the risky or dangerous
   responses associated with it on road. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
